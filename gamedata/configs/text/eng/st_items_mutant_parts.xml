Since all izloms suffer almost the same the deformation of the body, it is supposed that when the exposure took place all subjects were in the same body position - either because they were being transported at the time or because someone forced them. All specimens encountered so far were male and sterile. Hence it can be safely assumed that the izlom population is unable to reproduce, and their number in the Zone will be steadily getting lower.

		<text>While many stalkers consider crows no more than pests, more insightful ones acknowledge their usefulness in tackling the many challenges the Zone presents. While murders of crows can prove invaluable navigating and evading danger on the empty streets of Chernobyl and Pripyat, it's only after their death when their true value is manifested.\n \nThe population of crows grows constantly in spite of the increased knowledge of usefulness of their beaks. It seems accelerated adaptation, typical among Zone's fauna, has provided them with a sped-up reproduction cycle resulting in up to 4 egg lays a year. Their prolonged life-span, of up to 20 years, has given them extraordinary intelligence manifested especially when many crows are in close proximity.\n \nThis last effect has led to a rather peculiar custom among the some of the Zone-dwellers which - as rumor has it - was introduced by the very first Stalkers who arrived in the Zone after the Second Incident. The ritual - aptly referred to as "The Beak" - involves taking a pulverized beak from the eldest crow in the murder and creating a special mixture. When the concoction is consumed by the light of the full moon, it allows one's mind to temporarily merge with the multi-consciousness shared by all crows in the Zone. No one knows what happens to a fragile human mind when it is subjected to such an experience, but some speculate that this is what led the Stalker Noah to build his Arc in a desperate attempt to preserve whatever possible from the inevitable cataclysm that is about to once again fall upon this already devastated land.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] mutated body part\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] rare scientific specimen\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] valuable</text>
