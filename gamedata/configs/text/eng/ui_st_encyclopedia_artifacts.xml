Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artifact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artifact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artifact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified. Radiation output is highest on the artifact radiation scale. WARNING: Because of its organic nature and instability this artifact is well known to spontaneously combust more so than any other organic artifact and for this reason it is advised to abstain from wearing it in the vicinity of a fire or acid anomaly.\n \n%c[0,200,200,200]PROPERTIES:%c[0,140,140,140]\n \n%c[0,225,225,225] • %c[0,140,140,140] artifact\n%c[0,100,100,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] attachable</text>

Only yellow outer shell of the artifact appears to give off radiation and by careful processing it is possible to extract the non-radioactive blue parts for jewelery and other industrial purposes. This is due to the fact that if cleaned properly and polished, sapphire comparison becomes much more explicit: the stones are as hard and durable as this beautiful gem. This quality of theirs and their appearance make them perfect gemstones and jewelers all over the world strive to have them in stock. The usefulness of the artifact, however, is not limited to its industrial applications. There is scientific evidence suggesting that sapphire-like stones effectively protect from toxicity, whereas the outer shell slightly increases resistance to heat. Due to its density the weight of artifact has increased beyond normal standards, and thus it is one of the heaviest anomalous creations in the Zone.

For this reason, one is forced to weigh pros and cons of Crystal when in the vicinity of areas of high toxicity. It also acts as a conductor of electricity. Another positive effect possessed by this artifact is that it accelerates clotting if worn close to the body. (Side note: it is not recommended to keep this artifact in your possession for longer periods of time as blood clots can be hazardous to your health.) This artifact is also highly sought for by jewelers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1 cm of its outer layer emits radiation. It is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artifact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in death of the user.

Mama's Beads also possess potent protective qualities: they are able to shield the body and objects from extreme heat and acids. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of this artifact increases the corrosivity of acids, leading to accelerated deterioration of equipment and higher damage to tissues of any living organism. It is thus strongly advised to proceed with caution in acidic as well as in toxic environments when in possession of Mama's Beads. Another dangerous effect of this artifact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artifact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies.

Experienced stalkers say that Eye also brings luck. Irrespective of the validity of that statement, its positive effects are indeed quite potent. First of all, it reduces temperature of user's body and cools all objects in its vicinity. Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artifact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artifact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artifact in your backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish.

It resembles and acts like a sponge in this regard, but reveals its special characteristics only when exposed to certain external conditions. Firstly, when in the closest proximity of heat source it emits odor of burning flesh. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite. While this phenomenon leaves the artifact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artifact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment. Thirdly, the artifact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate.

Radiation output is lowest on the artifact radiation scale.\n \n%c[0,200,200,200]PROPERTIES:%c[0,140,140,140]\n \n%c[0,225,225,225] • %c[0,140,140,140] artifact\n%c[0,100,100,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] attachable</text>

		<text>%c[0,0,255,30]Information\n%c[0,140,140,140]This glowing artifact can generate a locally directed gravity field which increases its mass. For this reason, Nightstar is extremely heavy. It provides protection against acids as well as heat. Due to its beautiful inner core it is highly sought after by jewelers all over the world, however it is best to proceed with caution as unskilled treatment can cause the artifact to explode with power sufficient to level a small building. It is thus highly advised to perform the polishing by means of specialized machinery, which minimizes the probability of explosion. Moreover, only the outer core of the artifact emits radiation. Nightstar will also absorb toxic and chemical agents from the environment, which makes it a valuable artifact for artifact hunters, although the amount of toxicity absorbed is negligible. It is, however, relatively cheap and even stalkers with pretty tight budgets can afford it if opportunity to buy it arises. Radiation output is low on the artifact radiation scale.\n \n%c[0,200,200,200]PROPERTIES:%c[0,140,140,140]\n \n%c[0,225,225,225] • %c[0,140,140,140] artifact\n%c[0,100,100,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] attachable</text>

Thanks to its reasonable price and attractive appearance, this artifact is a valuable collector's item. Because of its organic nature, Soul is highly flammable and should not be carried near a campfire or most heat sources. It is known to spontaneously combust when exposed to temperature exceeding 60°C. The artifact provides a high level of toxic and chemical protection by absorbing chemical agents. It then uses them as basis for producing its gooey substance which, when applied to wounds, soothes the pain and speeds up healing process. On the other hand, Soul amplifies the effects of psy-waves and increases the damage of electricity to one's body. It is also known to drain power from its user. The artifact does not have high density and thus is not very heavy. Radiation output is low on the artifact radiation scale.\n \n%c[0,200,200,200]PROPERTIES:%c[0,140,140,140]\n \n%c[0,225,225,225] • %c[0,140,140,140] artifact\n%c[0,100,100,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] attachable</text>

Acting as a kind of sponge that absorbs chemical and toxic elements, this artifact provides protection from external toxic agents as well as from chemical particles that have already made their way into the body. Although it appears almost organic, it is actually more similar to coral. Due to its non-organic nature, it is nonflammable. It provides protection against acids as well as heat. There is no particular faction that takes great interest in it, so it is mostly sold to scientists who study and experiment on the artifact in order to find the use for it. It has high density and is thus extremely heavy.

This artifact can literally get a badly wounded stalker back on his feet in a matter of minutes. On the other hand, Firefly can spontaneously combust when exposed to potent heat sources. It also amplifies the harmful effects of both psy-fields and electro anomalies, and seems to drain stamina and decrease stamina recovery. However, it will absorb any and all deadly chemicals within one's body. Furthermore, it admirably protects against toxicity, and seems to inject neutralizing chemical agents into user's bloodstream, which negate the effects of toxins and nerve damage. For this reason, it is in high demand in military circles as it can make terrorist attacks with chemical or biological weapons more easily manageable. Unfortunately, Firefly is extremely rare.
