		<text>A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artifact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artifact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artifact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified. Radiation output is highest on the artifact radiation scale. WARNING: Because of its organic nature and instability this artifact is well known to spontaneously combust more so than any other organic artifact and for this reason it is advised to abstain from wearing it in the vicinity of a fire or acid anomaly.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,225,225,225] • %c[0,140,140,140] artifact\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] attachable</text>

Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artifact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price.

It is known to spontaneously combust when exposed to temperature exceeding 60°C. The artifact provides a high level of toxic and chemical protection by absorbing chemical agents. It then uses them as basis for producing its gooey substance which, when applied to wounds, soothes the pain and speeds up healing process. On the other hand, Soul amplifies the effects of psy-waves and increases the damage of electricity to one's body. It is also known to drain power from its user.

For unknown reasons, scientists are spreading rumors among stalkers that the artifact modifies bearer's genetic code, which is unproven and should be regarded as conscious attempt at monopolizing the supply of the artifact by the scientific community. This does not, however, mean that it is completely harmless. One drawback of this artifact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid electro anomalies when in possession of the artifact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones. It will also reduce energy recovery, which is the result of its sharp needle-like appendages. The needles cause small and quickly healing wounds which bring constant pain and itch, thus reducing stamina. This artifact also weakens protection against psy-emissions produced by anomalies or mutants as well as from heat and acids due to its high flammability. Given its chemical origin, it is also well known for its ability to increase user's protection against toxicity. Lightweight and not too much of a burden to carry around.

A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artifact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artifact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artifact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified.

While this phenomenon leaves the artifact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artifact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment. Thirdly, the artifact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate. Fourthly, Meat Chunk is also known to be a conductor of electricity much like the skin of a living creature. Certain sources within stalker community indicate further that it makes one feel physically drained when used for even short periods of time. Fifthly, probably the most beneficial feature of this artifact is its ability to slowly close up wounds and heal damaged tissues.

It is known to spontaneously combust when exposed to temperature exceeding 60°C. The artifact provides a high level of toxic and chemical protection by absorbing chemical agents. It then uses them as basis for producing its gooey substance which, when applied to wounds, soothes the pain and speeds up healing process. On the other hand, Soul amplifies the effects of psy-waves and increases the damage of electricity to one's body. It is also known to drain power from its user.

For unknown reasons, scientists are spreading rumors among stalkers that the artifact modifies bearer's genetic code, which is unproven and should be regarded as conscious attempt at monopolizing the supply of the artifact by the scientific community. This does not, however, mean that it is completely harmless. One drawback of this artifact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid electro anomalies when in possession of the artifact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones. It will also reduce energy recovery, which is the result of its sharp needle-like appendages. The needles cause small and quickly healing wounds which bring constant pain and itch, thus reducing stamina. This artifact also weakens protection against psy-emissions produced by anomalies or mutants as well as from heat and acids due to its high flammability. Given its chemical origin, it is also well known for its ability to increase user's protection against toxicity. Lightweight and not too much of a burden to carry around.

A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artifact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artifact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artifact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified.

As regards its effects, it is similar to the Eye in that it will reduce the temperature of user's body, which is especially useful when exposed to potent heat sources. It also acts as powerful resistor, and negates the effect of acids. Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artifact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned the reputation of a miraculous artifact. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, it shares not only positive but also negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artifact on the belt is suicide.

It resembles and acts like a sponge in this regard, but reveals its special characteristics only when exposed to certain external conditions. Firstly, when in the closest proximity of heat source it emits odor of burning flesh. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite. While this phenomenon leaves the artifact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artifact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment. Thirdly, the artifact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate. Fourthly, Meat Chunk is also known to be a conductor of electricity much like the skin of a living creature. Certain sources within stalker community indicate further that it makes one feel physically drained when used for even short periods of time.

This does not, however, mean that it is completely harmless. One drawback of this artifact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid electro anomalies when in possession of the artifact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones. It will also reduce energy recovery, which is the result of its sharp needle-like appendages. The needles cause small and quickly healing wounds which bring constant pain and itch, thus reducing stamina.

A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artifact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artifact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artifact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified.

Thanks to its unique properties, the artifact can significantly increase the bearer's muscle tone, thus greatly improving stamina recovery. Due to its high radioactivity, stalkers in possession of it are sometimes jokingly referred to as "Radioactive Snowflakes". When faced with the decision whether to carry it on the belt during a mission, you have to carefully weigh its pros and cons: does it pay to have greater endurance and high protection against electricity at the cost of being constantly exposed to its deadly radiation? Even if you are determined to take it with you, it should be noted that it is not to be used on long excursions to the Zone.

		<text>Mama's Beads in Lead-Lined Container. Shaped like a DNA helix, "Mama's beads" are created in the Burner anomaly. One of their most characteristic features is that they constantly pulsate, generating emissions beneficial to the human body. These emissions increase the metabolism of any living creature, accelerating coagulation and healing of wounds. The mechanism behind the effects of this artifact is still unknown. "Mama's beads" also possess potent protective qualities: they are able to shield the body and objects from extreme heat and acids. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of this artifact increases the corrosivity of acids, leading to accelerated deterioration of equipment and higher damage to tissues of any living organism. It is thus strongly advised to proceed with caution in acidic as well as in toxic environments when in possession of "Mama's beads". Another dangerous effect of this artifact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artifact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies. The weight is also quite high for such a small artifact, which leads to a conclusion that is of extremely high density.

		<text>Eye in Lead-Lined Container. This artifact, which resembles the human eye, considerably increases metabolism of the body, helping wounds heal quicker. Experienced stalkers say that Eye also brings luck. Irrespective of the validity of that statement, its positive effects are indeed quite potent. First of all, it reduces temperature of user's body and cools all objects in its vicinity. Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artifact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artifact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artifact in your backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish. The artifact is also known colloquially as "Copper eye" as it conducts electricity and amplifies its dangerous effects in the same way as copper does.

As regards its effects, it is similar to the Eye in that it will reduce the temperature of user's body, which is especially useful when exposed to potent heat sources. It also acts as powerful resistor, and negates the effect of acids. Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artifact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned the reputation of a miraculous artifact. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, it shares not only positive but also negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artifact on the belt is suicide.

It resembles and acts like a sponge in this regard, but reveals its special characteristics only when exposed to certain external conditions. Firstly, when in the closest proximity of heat source it emits odor of burning flesh. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite. While this phenomenon leaves the artifact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artifact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment. Thirdly, the artifact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate. Fourthly, Meat Chunk is also known to be a conductor of electricity much like the skin of a living creature. Certain sources within stalker community indicate further that it makes one feel physically drained when used for even short periods of time.

For unknown reasons, scientists are spreading rumors among stalkers that the artifact modifies bearer's genetic code, which is unproven and should be regarded as conscious attempt at monopolizing the supply of the artifact by the scientific community. This does not, however, mean that it is completely harmless. One drawback of this artifact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid electro anomalies when in possession of the artifact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones. It will also reduce energy recovery, which is the result of its sharp needle-like appendages. The needles cause small and quickly healing wounds which bring constant pain and itch, thus reducing stamina. This artifact also weakens protection against psy-emissions produced by anomalies or mutants as well as from heat and acids due to its high flammability.

A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artifact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artifact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artifact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified.

When the artifact comes into contact with the body, it will make one feel rejuvenated and thus it increases stamina recovery. This effect has in case of some stalkers induced hyperactivity. One downside of this artifact, however, is that it reduces the number of platelets in blood, thus increasing bleeding rate. Shell is extremely light and very portable.

		<text>Snowflake in Lead-Lined Container. Also colloquially known as "Radioactive Snowflake". At first glance, this artifact resembles a white Kolobok. Some claim that it actually is a form of Kolobok as it greatly increases resistance to electric currents by creating its own electric field and absorbing electricity that passes through user's body. Thanks to its unique properties, the artifact can significantly increase the bearer's muscle tone, thus greatly improving stamina recovery. Due to its high radioactivity, stalkers in possession of it are sometimes jokingly referred to as "Radioactive Snowflakes". When faced with the decision whether to carry it on the belt during a mission, you have to carefully weigh its pros and cons: does it pay to have greater endurance and high protection against electricity at the cost of being constantly exposed to its deadly radiation? Even if you are determined to take it with you, it should be noted that it is not to be used on long excursions to the Zone. Its usefulness in a fight is also debatable as it increases bleeding rate and prevents wounds from closing due to its very sharp appendages which sting the user and irritate the skin. It is, however, as light as a snowflake and very easy to carry around.
