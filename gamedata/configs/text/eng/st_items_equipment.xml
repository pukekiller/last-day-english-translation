		<text>Tushonka is a common name of canned, stewed meat produced in the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. The irony is that the idea originally came to Russia in a form of World War II aid transports from the United States. Since then, various kinds of tushonkas have become a primary means of long-time meat preservation, used both by the civilian population and as a standard-issue Red Army food ration. Despite their long expiry date, tushonkas are known for their high nutrition value (mostly owing to high fat content) and a relatively good taste. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has seen hundreds of types and tastes of tushonkas. In the spring of 2013 'Abakan' minced-meat brand remains the unquestionable king, and certainly the Zone has seen worse than that.\n \n

It is used as an abrasive in finishing and repair work for polishing wood or metal objects, cleaning household cookware, and sanding in light painting. Steel wool is made from low-carbon steel (carbon content is low enough to be close to plain iron). It is not made by drawing "steel wool wire" through a tapered die, but rather by a process more like broaching where a heavy steel wire is pulled through a toothed die that removes a thin wire shaving. Bundles of steel wool can be used in precision equipment cleaning and to improve spreading of lubricants and cleaning solvents.\n \n

%c[0,170,170,170]Iconic Red Army oil that has been in service for almost 70 years. The metal bottle is divided into two separate compartments, one for oil and the other one for the cleaning solvent. In the beginning, the solvent was based on an alkaline solution for effective clean-up of preservation salts in which ammunition was commonly shipped and stored. Since then, the composition of liquids has been modernized many times, but the simple yet ingenious 'double' bottle design remained unchanged. "Dvojka" is very popular in the Exclusion Zone due to its versatility. Bear in mind, however, that the oil requires adequate tools to be spread properly and so that it can reach deep into weapon's inner mechanisms. "Dvojka" should thus be regarded as more of an add-on than a stand-alone maintenance item.\n \n

It also by standard comes with set of elementary firearm spare parts. The kit is quite heavy, but is irreplaceable when venturing deep into the Zone as it can be used in life-or-death situations to make a firearm usable again. Due to differences in weapon construction this particular set can only be used for disassembly and repair of large-caliber rifles. It's also possible to additionally increase the effectiveness of the kit by borrowing certain materials from or combining with other kits during single maintenance session.\n \n

%c[0,170,170,170]A light sewing kit consisting of a cloth reel, several steel needles and a pair of scissors. It can be used to sew up bullet holes or ruptures in soft fabrics of outfits.

%c[0,170,170,170]M17 is a result of a Soviet military-industrial research project intended to devise an extremely potent, single-ingredient adhesive which could be used in any situation regardless of purpose and materials involved. It was decided to use a highly potent methacrylate which is most often optimized for reacting with either plastic or metal. In case of M17, however, this limitation has been bypassed, making the substance equally effective in both areas. In addition, the adhesive received a significant boost to versatility thanks to its hydrate form: it can be diluted with water and used in any concentration depending on the intended result. There is almost no damage that the glue, combined with appropriate materials, won't be able to repair. Can be used with all materials available in the Zone.\n \n

%c[0,170,170,170]A repair set allowing the user to perform emergency repairs of outfits. Includes military grade ducktape and ready-to-use sheets of thick textile in a variety of shapes and sizes which make it possible to quickly patch up any outfit damage. This is especially useful to prevent further structural damage of already damaged suits. Due to a relatively low durability of provided materials, the kit can be used only for minor repairs and is ineffective in case of harder materials like kevlar or metal. For this reason, the kit has a very limited use in headgear maintenance.\n \n

If in spite of the above, you still have doubts concerning its purity, you can always use akvatab. Due to the cost of production, military flasks are in a limited supply and are sold at a moderate price.

Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a disease caused by the bacteria Clostridium tetani which enter the body through open wounds and release a poison called tetanospasmin. Tetanus is a potentially deadly disease because the poison attacks the nervous system blocking nerve signals from the spinal cord to and from the muscles. Animals and mutants alike are prone to carry Clostridium tetani which can be transferred through bites. Injection of inactivated toxin enhances your immunological system and can lead to several positive side-effects. Moreover, this vaccine has been supplemented with several additional anti-toxins making it usable for purposes other than preventing contraction of tetanus.\n \n

		<text>A tarpaulin (or hootch) is a large sheet of strong, flexible, water-resistant or waterproof material, often cloth such as canvas or polyester coated with urethane, or made of plastics such as polyethylene. It has reinforced grommets at the corners and along the sides to form attachment points for rope, allowing them to be tied down or suspended. Serves many purposes, but is mainly used to create small and simple tent-like hideouts. Trading value is low due to easily found alternatives.\n \n

	<string id="st_mine_descr">
		<text>PFM-1 (short for ïðîòèâîïåõîòíàÿ ôóãàñíàÿ ìèíà; NATO name: "Green parrot") used to be a standard-issue anti-personnel mine of the Red Army, employed mainly during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Its widespread utilization during the conflict led to high civilian casualties, especially among children, since randomly scattered mines were often mistaken for toys due to their familiar shape and color. For this reason, the PFM-1 earned a sinister nickname: "Child killer." Since then, the mine has been replaced by newer models. However, as was the case with a variety of other 'retired' weaponry, a large number of these mines has somehow made its way into the Zone, becoming its primary booby-trap explosive. The mine is highly valued mainly for its functionality, user-friendliness, compact size and low weight, while its main drawback is a relatively small amount of explosive material: its power is often insufficient to kill a heavily armored stalker with a single blast. For this reason, the mine should be used in combination with other explosive materials and it acts as an igniter. If it is not armed, the mine will not detonate, even when hit with a gun.\n \n

In the Zone such canisters most often contain a composition of methane, propane, ethane and butane, and can be used for cooking or heating as well as for combat purposes. Upon direct gunfire, the canister may ignite and after a short while a rapid release of a considerable amount of energy may follow, causing the gas in the balloon to expand instantly and resulting in a delayed but powerful explosion with metal shrapnels going in every direction. Such canisters have been utilized as a weapon in the feuds between factions in the Zone killing many and crippling even more. If emptied, the balloon can be utilized for armor repairs.\n \n

While some Zoners are still trying to make the wrecks work again, others have found alternate ways of utilizing the jerrycans, namely, as improvised explosives.

Although heavy and cumbersome, it is extremely powerful, and a well-placed jerrycan can be lethal even if the target wears the heaviest of body armors. On the other hand, the explosion is often so potent that the killer becomes the victim himself, so it's best to use these canisters with caution. There are rumors that a veteran stalker named Yuya once saved his skin by luring a pseudogiant into a jerrycan trap.

%c[0,170,170,170]Although charcoal is available in the Zone at relatively cheap prices, you need to use a significant amount of it in order to prepare a single meal.

Even so, lighting a fire or a cigarette is very difficult if using the matchbox - thus, stalkers tend to purchase a more expensive but practical lighter.\n \n
