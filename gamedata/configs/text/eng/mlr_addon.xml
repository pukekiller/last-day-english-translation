		<text>Very well. I'll give the heads-up to the watch at the bridge. Once you get there, the one to speak to is "Gatekeeper". Just act cool, and please try to find something that would shed some light on the disappearance of Scar.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_3_2_2">
		<text>Well, I know something about your past. I could use your help, merc.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_3_2_3">
		<text>Uh... What kind of help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_3_2_4">
		<text>Could you talk to the mercs guarding the bridge in the Red Forest? I need to get to Limansk. I understand that this might be inconvenient, but I can promise you that I'll try to find any tracks left by the mercenary Scar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_3_2_5">
		<text>Hm. You gotta understand that I haven't been part of the Syndicate for a long time... Not even sure who runs the group at the bridge. I've got a few connections, but I'm gonna need some time for this... and some money. One hundred and fifty thousand, no less.</text>

	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_2_1_0">
		<text>Forester, I need to get across the Limansk bridge.</text>

		<text>You may have forgotten, but it is thanks to you that Limansk is now swarming with mercenaries.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_2_1_3">
		<text>I haven't forgotten, but you will not get any help from me, either. I'm still not sure if I did the right thing by helping those mercenaries.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_2_1_4">
		<text>Listen, you need to help me. What does it matter if you did the right thing or not? In any case, I can find out if I'll be able to reach the city.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_2_1_5">
		<text>If you don't tell me about everything this instant, you're going to get a free ticket to the morgue.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_2_1_6">
		<text>Old man, if the Zone wants me at Limansk, I'm gonna get there. It's in your best interest to help me, because no one knows if it'll be supportive to you next time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_2_1_7">
		<text>...I saw something in Scar - the Zone needed him. You, however... Yes, I'd like to know what happened to him. So, listen: we helped the mercenary detachment get out of the space anomaly. Once everything was settled, they paid me a visit. Looks like one of them snitched on me, told them I also took part in the rescue. I spoke to their leader, Leshiy, who gave me some provisions, money and ammunition - then he went on his way. In his own words, he headed off to the Army Warehouses - to Freedom. You can go look for him there - several years have passed, but judging by our conversation, his intentions to join them were serious.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_1_1_0">
		<text>I've heard something about the history of your group. I would like to investigate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_1_1_1">
		<text>You looking for something, or what? Hah, listen. You have virtually no chance of surviving in those areas - but even if you do, finding information about our stay there ain't exactly gonna be a walk in the park.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_1_1_2">
		<text>Aren't you interested? Or is there something you want in return?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_1_1_3">
		<text>Hmm... You can help us take out a pack of bloodsuckers in the swamp, and maybe then I'll share what I've got with you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_1_1_4">
		<text>Fine, give me the coordinates.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_1_1_5">
		<text>There you go - have fun.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_1_2_0">
		<text>It's done. What info do you have?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_1_2_1">
		<text>So I've heard - well done. You're a good fighter and I trust you, so I'll give you what you need. The boys have probably told you about the assault at that damned bridge in Limansk. In case you don't know... Back then, in the city - as well as the surrounding area in the Red Forest - mercenaries were in charge of everything. Of course, they aren't going to just lower the bridge for you, but there is a live participant in those events - they call him Forester. It was him, along with Scar, who somehow agreed that a group of "standards" would lower the bridge while our fighters protected them from the other shore. Here, I'll give you info on a route between the Army Warehouses and the Red Forest - use it to find Forester and talk to him. And here's a reward for the bloodsucker cleanup.</text>

			<text>I'm listening.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_11">
			<text>The old man is in the Great Swamp, always waiting for his friend Strelok. Someone came up to him recently, and the Doctor told him his story and everything else important - the story of Strelok's group itself! You can go to him and see it for yourself.</text>

			<text>This very stalker who went to Doctor is now looking for traces of Strelok's group. He's already been to the laboratories in Dark Valley and Yantar, and it's obvious he ain't stopping there.

		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_14">
			<text>Have you ever heard about the Generators? Until recently, they were only considered a myth... but after Strelok's second campaign to the center of the Zone, there's no doubt they're real. There have been constant disputes about what they are, but old satellite imagery suggests some kind of weird infrastructure, in whose honor the entire area was named. Apparently, that's the place where Monolith carry out their orders and all important processes on the territory of the Zone. So, the stalker's already gone there and I think he's serious - his intervention might have a major impact on the Zone. The leaders of a few groups have already expressed their discontent regarding this information.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="fanat_kmb_3_start_1">
		<text>You'll see. As you know, the most insidious enemy of man - strangely enough - remains a man. For a long time, we've kept the vehicle station clear of all the bandits, but they keep coming back. They've been a steady threat, usually numbering from around five to seven. Let's go take care of them.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_kmb_3_start1_0">
		<text>Hah, the two of us against these... We're heroes!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_kmb_3_start1_1">
		<text>What you just called heroism here is commonplace for more experienced stalkers. Anyway, let's head back to the village.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_kmb_3_start2_0">
		<text>It's nice that we've got a mentor like you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_kmb_3_start2_1">
		<text>Thank you, although I'm not the first - that honor goes to Wolf. I need to catch my breath, that tired me out... Oh, and I've got some info on a route from Agroprom to Yantar in case you haven't already heard of it. Rest up for a bit, and then... Agh, who am I to tell you what to do? You've certainly proven to be your own stalker, and you should be proud of it. Be free.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_kmb_2_start_0">
		<text>I'm ready, what now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_kmb_2_start_1">
		<text>Tell me, what self-respecting stalker has never found another's secrets? The Zone is common to everybody here. Those who manage, eat. Sometimes, finding a stash is not just an achievement, but a necessity. I've hidden a backpack somewhere in the village - try to find it.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_kmb_2_start1_0">
		<text>Found it... Thanks for the artifact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_kmb_2_start1_1">
		<text>Huh... I see that with your level of perception, the Zone won't be taking you so easily. Your final lesson is about to start. Take some time to prepare.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_kmb_1_start_0">
		<text>Oh, a new face? Would you like to go through some basic training?</text>

	<string id="fanat_kmb_1_start_2">
		<text>No, thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_kmb_1_start_3">
		<text>Excellent. The biggest threat around here are the mutants. There's a herd of boars by the ravine - you and I are going to clear the place out. Try and keep them off me.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Phew, that was crazy. What now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_kmb_1_start1_1">
		<text>Well done. See if your knife's strong enough to get a few parts off of them. When you're done, let's head to the nearest anomalous zone.</text>

		<text>What's next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_kmb_1_start2_2">
		<text>So, this pit is full of gravitational anomalies. See the artifact over there? It's called a Jellyfish, and Jellyfishes, along with every other artifact, have both positive and negative qualities... We're quite fortunate to have found one. Here, a simple detector you can use to find artifacts. Here's a bottle of Nemiroff - take a swig, in case you manage to catch any radiation. Now, take a few bolts and throw them in front of you to check if the path's safe. Let's go. I'll cover you from here on.</text>

		<text>Of course. Have you seen how many zombies have gathered in the Garbage? Quite strange, it hasn't been like that before... Anyway, I'll give you the coordinates to the largest cluster of these creatures, and you'll clean up everything there. What do you say?</text>

		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barmen_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_1">
		<text>Well, I'm basically a local barman, or a manager of provisions... whichever you prefer. You could say that I'm one of the few who participated in cleaning up the accident at the nuclear power plant. I'm not exactly from here, but I decided to go to the Zone on contract. I've got some experience on me, hah.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barmen_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_2">
		<text>How was it there?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barmen_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_3">
		<text>I was just an army draftee back then, only ever got to measure radioactivity and clean it up. However, the guys near the power station ended up waist-deep in shit. Even our technology died from the radiation, let alone the people... imagine that. So, they cleaned the roofs of graphite with freakin' shovels. Radiation is a strange thing - it curses some and spares others, like Dyatlov, who survived to end up in prison.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="rogovets_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_0">
		<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rogovets_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_1">
		<text>I serve as a medic. I went out on a contract here and was almost immediately assigned to the Fairway group, after some preparation. We were somehow stuck in Pripyat after the collapse of the operation - well, those of us who were still alive... then a man from the USS helped us, and then they evacuated us. I still can't get this one case out of my head: our commander sent me and a couple of guys to the kindergarten, in which - according to preliminary data - there was a device that interfered with radio communications. I don't know what came over me, I wasn't feeling myself – I couldn't see, I didn't know where my comrades were, and something pulled a veil straight over my eyes. Right in that kindergarten, I found a damn refrigerator and hid there. Then, I heard an explosion right above me and I immediately felt better for whatever reason, but the refrigerator locked up and I couldn't get out without outside help. I don't recall if I locked myself in it or if it was a poltergeist that held the door closed...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rogovets_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_1">
		<text>And then what happened? Why didn't you quit?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rogovets_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_2">
		<text>Well... I need the money, why would I have come back here otherwise? And doctors are always useful... However, there aren't a lot of them in the army at this point. Fortunately, though, I wasn't demoted for the failure of the operation, but I wasn't praised, either - unlike the major, who, by the way, is also hanging around somewhere here in the Zone.</text>

	<string id="rogovets_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_3">

		<text>That's correct. I can provide ammunition, which our guys find in raids from time to time, in exchange for any foreign munitions you bring us. We also have some foreign ones, and the exchange ratio for everything expect RPG warheads is one to one. The weapons we have are all fine and dandy, but a few prefer using more domestic firearms, ammunition for which is more abundant - having anything to shoot with helps keep us alive and well. I can also give you RPG projectiles and M209 underbarrel grenades, which we've received in abundance for carrying out tasks, though unfortunately, we don't have any more grenade launchers to go with it.

I'd head over there again with the guys, but there aren't many of us left and it'd be too much to handle, since we'd rather not spend any more manpower than we need to trying to somehow get away from the center of the fucking Zone.

For ten bottles, I can share one mag of 7.62mm 7N1. And for twenty bottles, I'll fetch you an entire Berill suit from the bins.

During one of such visits I was offered a place in the the Syndicate. It was barely upholding at the time, so Dushman and I are sort of pioneers in this. So what? The roundabouts are fitting, there are people who've been in Afghanistan and Georgia. But people from the Baltic aren't too eager to come, never mind the first world countries.</text>

		<text>Heard that you're interested in faction patches.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_aslan_about_lottery_1">
		<text>How can I put this? Personally, no, I'm not "interested" in them - however, with morale being rather low lately, it's an optimal method for our guys to earn some spoils of war. Plus, the high-ups want them. Here's how it works: you bring me patches from stalkers, you get some gear or nothing at all. All of it for ten patches of any faction, apart from those of Ecologists and the Monolith, you have a chance to get a subpar artifact, or not get jack shit. With fifty patches, you'll have a chance to get a decent artifact and some rather solid gear, but there's also a chance that you won't get anything. And for ten Monolith or Ecologist patches, you will get a pretty good artifact with the same chance as for fifty patches of any other faction. Fifty Monolith or Ecologist patches will guarantee you an outstanding item and good equipment dedicated only to the most experienced of stalkers, no chance of losing. You might ask, "why so generous?"... Because many people prefer to keep the patches for themselves as combat trophies.</text>

		<text>Are you another bandit? Why haven't you opened fire yet?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_1">
		<text>Heh, no. I'm not a bandit, and I won't shoot unless you give me a good reason to. I'm a hunter, but I wouldn't put it past anyone in the Zone to mistake me for a bandit. Those pigs were just here out of coincidence, then you showed to clean up. As you can see, I manage a small, cozy, and generally safe bar... well, for the most part. By the way, name's Butcher.</text>

	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_2">
		<text>So you're an artifact hunter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_3">
		<text>Eh, not quite. We don't collect artifacts, we don't adhere to any common views on the Zone and we certainly don't try to unravel its secrets. All we do is hunt mutants, and not because they represent - in our opinion - a threat, as Duty seems to wholeheartedly believe, but because of the thrill of the hunt. Many of us were former hunters, both amateurs and professionals outside of the Zone, though many perished, since they weren't expecting the level of... unpredictability the Zone showed them.</text>

	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_4">
		<text>I see. Well, you work at a bar. Do you have anything for sale?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_5">
		<text>I do, though my stock is nothing special. Some stalkers bring mutant parts to me and I sell them. Also have a few other goods, like provisions, medicine and equipment. And if you're up for hunting mutants for coin, I've got a few jobs.</text>

		<text>Why don't the traders and guards at the flea market live in the hangar? It seems a lot safer, and more habitable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_baraholka_hunter_trader_1">
		<text>The stalkers at the flea market have been around for a few years at this point, while we've only gotten here recently... though, they were dispersed by Duty because they usually sell things considered "dangerous". What a fucking joke. Apparently, they somehow made an agreement with them. They really don't have anything to do here and they don't understand us, and frankly we don't understand them and their ideals. We hunt to survive, while they sit at their flea market like owls, collecting goodies and artifacts. Generally, those guys are pretty strange... but they're alright.</text>

	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_0">
		<text>Since you're an expert hunter, I'd like to know some more about mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_1">
		<text>There are a few cute rodents in the Zone, called "tushkanos". You've seen them for sure. They don't really appear dangerous, but in packs, they can easily kill even an experienced stalker. There was a case where a special squad of Dutyers went to sweep a bloodsucker lair. Those idiots made camp somewhere in the middle of the Agroprom complex... One of the guys took off somewhere while another screwed around on his PDA. No one was keeping the night watch. Morning came, and no one was there - something was wrong. The first people to enter that room were in for a big surprise... The throats of the squad members had been all chewed up. Typical tushkano traces. God knows why the rodents just up and left their meal. Anyway, the rest of the soldiers decided to head to the lair and finish the job, writing off the deaths of their comrades afterwards. That's how those men perished. Some stalker ended up retrieving their PDAs, having a new story to tell in the Bar for shits and giggles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_2">
		<text>Every rookie encounters a few dogs at the Cordon, as well as in the Great Land. They don't really differ that much from their "prototypes", so to speak - except they're blind, but that doesn't really keep them down, since their other senses have evolved... especially their ability to smell. They can take out newbies like fish in a barrel, and sometimes more experienced stalkers, too, mostly thanks to their maneuverability and sudden strikes. Hey, here's a story for you... Somebody made it a habit to snatch some sausage from the Bar. Everyone raised some fuss, tore up the security, and some men from Duty even ended up keeping watch and check who was stealing. Eventually, they saw a dog run in through a hole in the fence and, naturally, shot it down. In the morning, a solemn-looking stalker comes into the Bar and asks about the dog... Barman realizes what's happening and tells him to ask the guys from Duty. Turns out the fresh-faced lad was moving to the Zone with that dead dog, who was his pet. They went though a lot... The guy was also an orphan, and then this happens to him. Ever since that moment, any wise guy who crosses the border into the Zone with a pet either keeps moving or makes dinner out of his "little friend" for other stalkers... just to keep tensions low. By the way, all that sausage was actually stolen by a local alcoholic.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_3">
		<text>There are dogs, and there are pseudodogs. Why "pseudo", you ask? Well, they originally evolved from wild wolves. On their own, they are easily dispatched by point blank buckshot rounds, much like ordinary wild dogs. However, a pack of pseudodogs is nothing to scoff at. Moreover, they conjure clones of themselves that swarm you... and when that happens, you need to find and kill the real one for the phantoms to stop appearing, otherwise you end up wasting precious ammo and risk getting yourself badly hurt.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_4">
		<text>Let me tell you about snorks. The most common theory is that they are former military personnel who guarded the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant before the second explosion, when it completely fried their brains and turned them into abominations. Something like a zombie, only... even more bestial and primitive. They crawl on all fours, claw, kick, and even pounce fairly long distances to close in on their prey. Just one is dangerous, but a group of them? Might as well off yourself right then and there. If you ever come across snorks, sidestep their pounce, then blast their ass full of lead. Heck, if you're confident, but also have a death wish, you can kill them in midair. Good luck with that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_5">
		<text>Zombies. You know those cheap American movies where zombies just grunt, moan, and attack with their hands? Well, it ain't like that in Zone... sort of. Most zombies here are former stalkers, their brains completely mashed, torn, and battered by the Brain Scorcher. A lot of them still retain their speech, and are also capable of operating firearms. Nobody understands what they say... although, a friend of mine recently came to visit after a long expedition in Jupiter, and he was attacked by zombies. The paleness of his face said it all... Said they were begging for help, that they were tired, hungry. Who knows. Poor bastard. Sakharov can give you a better understanding. There's also a more barbaric, generic type of zombie, like the ones you see in movies. They're slow, and not at all capable of using guns, so it should be simple to kill them... Just don't let them corner you. They are also masters of feigning. Shoot them anywhere other than the head, they'll fall over and wait for your closure. You get your knife out, then stab the fuckers right in the skull. If you're skilled enough, you can even have at them them while they're moving.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_6">
		<text>Bloodsuckers? Let's see. Rumor has it they're mutated human beings. Whether or not they mutated from the radiation after the explosions or were scientifically modified by other humans, I don't know. What I do know, however, is that they're one of the most dangerous predators inhabiting the Zone. Not only do they boast incredible speed, but they also camouflage themselves, making them extremely dangerous and aggressive beasts. They use stealth and circle around you, tiring your legs out, waiting for the perfect moment to strike - and when they do, you lose consciousness. See, their name speaks for itself. They drain so much blood that by the time you unhinge those slimy feelers off your neck, you might as well be a piece of paper floating in the wind. I've heard stories of a stalker having committed suicide while being circled indefinitely by a bloodsucker. It's almost like a game to them, really. When they're not sucking your blood through a straw, their razor sharp claws come into play. Just like snorks, you can avoid their attacks, but you gotta expect it - be alert, use a shotgun, aim for the head, then fire. Rookies end up with empty mags and unique wounds. You'd better find a high spot or stick close to an object, so that you don't creak up behind and look at both of them, because suddenly this bastard will appear before you, but squeeze and shoot the weapon more tightly. That's the best tactic if they find you alone. Running away from them is problematic.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_7">
		<text>Burers. They are near-legendary creatures, the existence of which many don't even want to know... Personally, I shit myself with fear just thinking about them. The best advice I can give regarding burers is not to go in dungeons and any kinds of empty complexes, laboratories in particular, because they love dwelling in such places. Recently, though, they have been sighted in pretty much every place in the Zone, and this is primarily thanks to to the actions of the Marked One, who turned off the Brain Scorcher. Chimeras too, for example, used to live closer to the center of the Zone, but then suddenly migrated and increased their population. Apparently, someone who runs all of this in the center of the Zone has got some influence over these creatures, and uses them as a kind of Cerberus on the last approaches towards their "stronghold". If you get into trouble and end up unable to escape, I'd advise you to protect your head, because they've got relatively powerful telekinesis powers. They can also send a focused impulse and knock you off your feet, as well as take away your weapons and exhaust you, somehow influencing the gravity around you. They resemble fat, hideous dwarfs, who wear huge shoes with their own characteristic sounds, as well as black cloaks, strangely enough sewn almost their size. I too think that they are the result of experiments in secret laboratories. There are also different subspecies of burers - for example, fire and electric, just like poltergeists. Some argue that the poltergeist is an evolutionary stage of the burer... however, if an electric poltergeist acts on you only with telekinesis, then a corresponding burer can easily throw a ball of lightning at you or even a whole Electra anomaly, the size of a substation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_8">
		<text>Controllers are no joke: those monsters emit a steady psy-background, and they can manipulate the consciousness of any person. It's absolutely fatal to approach them without the right type of protection, and you're generally better off staying away from any places they might be dwelling in. They'll most likely just burn your brain out - not even zombifying you - in order to make some juicy grub out of you right then and there. Legend's going around saying that they can even talk, but I don't really believe it... Their high level of intellect is beyond doubt, though. Sometimes they can stage clever ambushes. They often wander alone, greedy for food, or thinking about whatever goes on in that screwed-up head of theirs... A stalker once dropped by and told me and the boys that there was a weird creature that settled down around Rostok. He went to have a look, but was stopped by a sudden, severe headache that almost made him drop his gun. So, he backed off, thinking it was just radiation... The rest of us went with him to scoop the place out, came in – and I also felt a headache! Later we went back prepared, having taken some special pills that basically killed any emotions we had... I looked around and saw a man-shaped figure sitting in the darkness. I opened fire, but it disappeared - and then, the bastard came out behind my back, and I shot him. Then I heard a faint, yet familiar voice... and couldn't believe it. I shot down my friend Vasyuk. Eventually we managed to get rid of that mutant freak, but I quit hunting ever since and ended up opening a bar here. I was fortunate not to get killed... Redhead was a smart guy, so he took off to the north after what happened.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_9">
		<text>And the cats... Have you seen those things? Oh, god. Only this place can turn pets into feral beasts. Their whole thyroid gland is swollen from all the radiation, along with tumors in their cheeks. I don't know why those cats have become like this. These creatures have become bigger with sharper claws, and they run like crazy. People usually have to get domestic cats down from trees... Here, you're the one who gets chased around. To make matters worse, they've developed a pack mentality, similar to dogs and wolves. These creatures are wild and they can be found anywhere, so keep an eye on your surroundings at all times. They come running, and if you aren't careful, they will cling onto your ass and bite a chunk off it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_10">
		<text>Not many people here believe in the paranormal, and everyone has their own faith. Some people believe in their own strength, some believe in their leaders and some believe in alien intervention... but certainly not in God. However, there is still a monster by the name of "poltergeist", because how else would you describe a translucent flying shit that throws objects at you? Still, there's pretty much nothing in common between the mutant and the type of entity in folklore. You can kill it in quite ordinary ways, it doesn't react to salt - we had a poor bastard that tried it - and looks like a flying electric anomaly, or less commonly, a fire essence. The electric one, like a burer, loves showering you with all sorts of random garbage, but the fire one is able to somehow create a jet of fire right in front of your fucking face - similar in effect to a geyser, and extremely hot. Shoot directly into the essence - you won't miss, but it is very difficult to kill because of its speed and maneuverability. In a few cases, stalkers have spotted some kind of black or smoky poltergeist. Nothing certain is known about its properties, but it's quite a rare specimen, and probably because meeting with it means death in the overwhelming majority of cases. It is even more difficult to kill because the smoke is much less localized, and thus aiming and shooting at its core is harder.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_11">
		<text>There are also creatures whose tales are told in front of campfires. They are called Fractures. Humanoid creatures with hypertrophic arms and necks, they possess an abnormal hand that can break a person's chest, while the other is more often than not normal, without any anomalous property. There are a lot of stories about the fact that Fractures often like to come into contact with stalkers and ask for all kinds of crap, from cans to imported toothpaste. If you aren't lucky and you don't have what it asks of you, then prepare for battle or certain death... especially death, because Fractures often come into contact during a favorable situation for them; for example, if you are alone and he's already holding you from behind with his bucketed hand. If you have what he asks of you, then don't rush and hand it over; then move away from it quietly and on all fours, it won't harm you. Well, it's all stories, who knows. Some even leave provisions in places where Fractures have been seen, in vain hopes to drive them off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_12">
		<text>Here's another one: the pseudogiant. Usually, its height never exceeds that of a human's... however, its powerful paws can cause very strong shock waves, which is how it earned its name. Until recently, again, nothing about it was known, and it is most likely another of those abominations from the laboratories, thanks to the underground assholes who love to rummage around every single complex and not close any doors behind them. To the north, there was some kind of military guy who never shut the door at some facility... at the Iron Forest in Zaton, I believe. Since then, these giants have been observed even in the vicinity of the Jupiter plant. By looking at some of its features, it is possible to determine that "it" was once a man... like the small, hanging arms in front of the main ones, its skin, and a few other characteristics. It's got some sharp teeth, but don't worry about that - it's more likely to just knock you down and crush you. And don't take its awkward appearance into account, because it never falls down and never goes astray. The best thing to do before going near an area where a pseudogiant has been spotted is to grab a couple of rifle grenades and a machine gun, as the skin and bones of the mutant show excellent resistance to small arms, and the creature itself is very resilient.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_13">
		<text>The chimera can rightfully be considered at the top of the food chain in the Zone. How come? It is a very clever creature - a nocturnal predator that can pounce at you with a single jump from a distance of several tens of meters. Four-legged mutant, has two heads, for which it has received its nickname. It is also very durable and has sharp claws, capable of tearing through even the skin of a pseudogiant. It lets out a characteristic roar while jumping, frighteningly similar to a person's. They've have mainly been encountered in the northern parts of the Zone, in open places near facilities or complexes. As told by local hunter Trapper, they have their own sphere of influence, where they rest and hunt during late at night. There is also a subspecies, namely the black chimera. It cannot be seen at all in the dark, which makes it much more dangerous than its relatives - the usual ones have almost human skin color. It is also said to be stronger and more enduring. Escaping from a chimera is impossible - it's better to find a narrow room that will reduce its ability to maneuver, or try to jump aside while it leaps at you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_14">
		<text>Wild boars and flesh. The latter are an example of a terribly mutated pig, as proven by scientists - rather sluggish and weak... Only a complete moron could get under its "bladed" paws, which will penetrate virtually any armor. As for boars, differ little from their relatives outside the Zone, apart from the fact that they are larger and more dangerous... Oh, and their hooves are much stronger, and can cut through fabric and human flesh effortlessly. It's enough just to jump aside and move somewhere in a couple of meters when these beasts rush at you, to avoid their fangs. Oftentimes, the meat of both wild boars and flesh is consumed, but not without being treated beforehand, to avoid radiation poisoning.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_15">
		<text>Karliks... Thanks for helping me gather information about them - here's what I've jotted down. They mainly reside in underground complexes, most of which have previously been used for experiments on people. Apparently, Karliks are the result of such experiments. They possess supernatural strength, good speed and attack most often in groups. At the moment, only one subspecies has been discovered – smoked ones. Dirty, mutated by anomalies, they emit dangerous radiation, it is better not to go near them without a Wrenched or a Bubble in your pocket.</text>

	<string id="in_freedom_1">
		<text>Not to toot my own horn, but we're actually one of the strongest factions in the Zone, heh. We control and guard the Barrier, and we try to prevent those Duty assholes from coming here, because the goals we have are, in fact, very different. We want to co-exist with the Zone, in the best sense of the word - we believe that it is a gift to humanity. You ask how? Look around! This whole place is like a fairy tale. Anomalies that violently violate the laws of physics and creatures with amazing "properties", none of which I believe should be wiped out. Perhaps they can somehow coexist with us, or maybe we can at least borrow something from them. Nevertheless, we don't recognize the "official" approach to the Zone. Scientists may be doing a noble job, sure, but, like... All that stuff is gonna be kept by oligarchs, so what's left for common folk, you know? We just want to share the wonders of the Zone with the public, so that people won't be afraid of what they hear from the mainstream media. Instead, they'll start respecting it. Can you imagine how we, and only we, can advance in development? And what's worse is that the heads of the government can potentially develop some kind of weapon if they understand the psy-stuff that goes on around here. Anyway, we have no rules here, but discipline is still needed for banal survival, so during operations, our fighters obey the commands of the senior and experienced stalkers in the detachment. But all this is nothing more than a necessity. Are you interested in joining? We're always in need of stalkers who share our vision.</text>

		<text>Any free info can you share about the surrounding area?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_1">
		<text>Usually info is how I make a living, but since everything's quiet anyway, I can give you a bit of an insight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_2">
		<text>I'm all ears.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_3">
		<text>Well, you're in Rostok. It's completely safe for anyone on good terms with Duty. To the west lies the Wild Territory, former western part of the Rostok factory. Rumors advise against going there at night. The best kill zones are held by the mercs, so you'll likely be getting shot from two sides. There are mutants in the lower lands, and it's better to stay at a height provided by warehouses... Although, the mercs have them covered. That's all about the Wild Territory. To the north lie the Army Warehouses, held by Duty's "best friend", Freedom. There's nothing particularly interesting going on there, but it's the last shelter around for sane people. To the east is the Truck Cemetery - stock up on anti-radiation supplies and ammo if you're going there. There are a lot of mutants and sometimes the radiation is way past what even we consider to be normal. To the south is the Garbage - complete anarchy going on over there... You've got mutants and thugs, but you've also got a neat marketplace. Plus, there's some kind of hunter in the train hangar who might have some jobs to offer. That's all for the roundabouts, need anything else?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_4">
		<text>You mentioned something about a shelter for sane people?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_5">
		<text>Well, north of the warehouses is the Radar, an eerie place held by the Monolith. It's best to stay away from there - no way of getting in with the psy-installation they've got set up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_6">
		<text>Thanks for the info.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="story_dolg_0">
		<text>What's the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_1">
		<text>Things are quiet with Freedom. Of course, there's no chance in hell we're leaving them alone - gotta keep our guard up. Other than that, the bandits aren't particularly dangerous. The Blues Brothers to the west and northwest aren't as interested in us as much as we are in them, but there's no way to be sure. Again, gotta keep your eyes peeled, especially when they're carrying out any operations. Other groups and clans don't pose any threat, with the exception of the Monolith. It seems to me that something's out there, and it can't be any good. Fortunately, Freedom's the one who has to worry about any border attacks by those fanatics.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_2">
		<text>How's Duty doing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_3">
		<text>Solid three out of five - decent. What's good is the shaky stability in terms of fighters and their influx, people are going - so not everything is lost. What's bad is that the control of the territories at the southern approaches to the eastern part of Pripyat - we couldn't hold on to the Yanov station. The southern approaches to the Bar are constantly under attack by bandits and mutants, and they are sometimes pushed by the mercs from the east.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_4">
		<text>How did you lose your position in Yanov?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_5">
		<text>We had a weak link. Our idiot supplier was caught doing things he shouldn't have done... The bastard started handing out weapons to the average Joe, mostly bandits and mercenaries. He got caught by local stalkers and was killed while making a deal with a few bandits. I was presented with claims as a leader. Then an unknown stalker appeared and got rid of us... And that's how we're here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_6">
		<text>Understood.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="story_dolg_m_0">
		<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_1">
		<text>I used to be stationed at the Agroprom Research Institute before I got a promotion. Before the Zone came into existence, I was a car mechanic. Duty noticed my skills as a handyman after I had been around for a while, so they decided to assign me as technician here. I prefer tinkering with heavy firearms and assault weapons... hate working on snipers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_2">
		<text>What's that smell? Didn't think Duty allowed drinking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_3">
		<text>Man, it's hard getting by without a drink... The work is pretty tedious, and boring. I wish I could go back to the Agroprom, but our base there is gone now. If I hadn't been relocated, I don't even know if I'd be alive - they say the base was lost during an emission in twenty-eleven... Huh, looks like we've gone way off topic. Anyway, don't be shy, now - show me your toys if you need 'em fixed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_4">
		<text>I'll see if I have anything.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="story_b_cs_0">
		<text>What can you tell me about Cold?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_1">
		<text>What can I say? He's earned quite a bit of respect as the current leader of our organization.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_2">
		<text>How did he earn that respect?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_3">
		<text>You see, there was some controversy regarding Lebedev, our former leader - who, by the way, I personally never met - and he didn't seem to take the opinions of the faction members into account during their crusade towards the CNPP. That mercenary certainly helped us out, but in the end, it just wasn't worth it. Those who remained at the base were unable to fight back against a resurgence made by the Renegades. The significance of our struggle in the swamps was reduced to zero... and the sacrifices on the way to the Chernobyl NPP, as well as the swamps, turned out to be in vain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_4">
		<text>It seems like the faction's resentment towards their leader at that time was justified.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_5">
		<text>There's more to it... After our troops had returned, we had to start a long war to take everything back. We wouldn't be able to manage in day-to-day life without Cold. He received some help from unaffiliated stalkers and got in touch with people throughout the Garbage and the Cordon. Free stalkers helped us out, and having a charismatic leader certainly didn't hurt. Moreover, he's given an order to all fighters - without exceptions - not to leave here. We'll take any help, but we won't risk the lives of our guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_6">
		<text>Whoever Lebedev was and what he did, you aren't the same faction you used to be.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_7">
		<text>That's your opinion. Certainly has some value to it. Right now, we have no large-scale goals, nor any common ideology... Anyway, it's probably time we cut the storytelling and start the trading.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_8">
		<text>Deal.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="story_dog_0">
		<text>Whose pseudodog is that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_1">
		<text>That's Buddy, the Doctor's dog. Doctor asked Cold to keep him safe, as he's started getting a little old.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_2">
		<text>Well, by the looks of it, you wouldn't say that he needs it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_3">
		<text>Looks can be deceiving sometimes. Pet a kind-hearted creature. Now, can I tell you about these dogs and answer your questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_4">
		<text>Go ahead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_5">
		<text>Pseudodogs aren't really dogs at all. They kind of originate from wolves - Duty learned that while researching them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_6">
		<text>That's... I need to write that down. What's the request, anyway?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_7">
		<text>By virtue of my profession, I collect all sorts of stories. To the north, there's a place similar to our swamps called Zaton. I've heard there's an old crank that lives in the old barge, and apparently, he also has a pseudodog. Perhaps you can find out if it's true, if the distance doesn't bother you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_8">
		<text>I'll check if possible.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="owl_story_0">
		<text>Tell me about this quiet harbor.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="owl_story_1">
		<text>There was this strange stalker, turned out to be a major of the USS. He was a good help, and he also dealt with quite a few dangers. It's only recently that everything went downhill... The Yantar psy-emitter and Brain Scorcher are both working again. There are clearly activities going on at the Chernobyl NPP, and it's within reach. A squad of experienced stalkers went MIA, and after that another squad stumbled upon some Monolith near the sawmill, from what I heard. After that rumble with those fighters, people left, and the mutants have been using that to their advantage: they come up to this wreck almost all the time. Anyway... Generally, the northern part of Zaton is to be avoided.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="owl_story_2">
		<text>Is there anything important to keep in mind?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="owl_story_3">
		<text>Always - the local situation has given me a few more matters to deal with. People from the Great Land are losing their children, their husbands, their brothers... and of course, they themselves are no indifferent to their own fate. Lots of people have come to the Zone after hearing rumors about the money you can make here, and they also hide from problems of a different nature. I need their PDAs, and you'll be rewarded for any you can bring here. Capisce?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="owl_story_4">
		<text>So the North is afraid... Got it.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="boroda_story_0">
		<text>You must be Beard.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="boroda_story_1">
		<text>That's right. I haven't seen you around before - welcome to the Skadovsk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="boroda_story_2">
		<text>Thank you. What can I do here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="boroda_story_3">
		<text>Whatever you prefer doing. Ever since the departure of Sultan, the hunt for artifacts around here has been more of a breeze than ever. If you plan on going south in the direction of the substation workshops and the waste processing station, be careful. The Syndicate holds those territories, and they pose quite a threat. If you happen to find any artifacts, feel free to bring them here - I'll be more than happy to offer you a decent price. Stay safe around these parts, stalker.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="boroda_story_4">
		<text>Thank you.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="aslan_st_0">
		<text>What's the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_1">
		<text>Well, the Syndicate only has one central base in the Zone, and it's right here. The path to Yantar is cut off because of the psy-installation, and crowds of zombies sometimes come out of there, along with mutants. Limansk has gone to shit - it's a maze full of dangers. The Red Forest is even more dangerous, since Monolith fighters have settled at the bridge to Limansk while the rest of the area is crawling with mutants. At the Army Warehouses in the east, it's all Freedom territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_2">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_3">
		<text>As for any dangers, you'll see those for yourself. Keep in mind, though; when carrying out orders, you've got a job to do, and any emotions are just gonna distract you. Put those aside... There's no room for emotion, no room for morality - only intellect and calculation. And regarding other paths, the safest route is through Limansk. There's plenty of closed space where you'll be safe from sniper fire, and there is shelter where you can hide from firefights, as well as anomalies. The area's quite unpredictable, however - never gonna know what exactly's around the corner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_4">
		<text>You say the base is central. Does that mean there are any other outposts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_5">
		<text>There are two minor ones that I know of. The first one is in Zaton, at the edge of the northern marshes. The second one is in the southwest part of the Pripyat outskirts. We've also got a group stationed in the Wild Territory, and you can find our squads in different parts of the Zone when they carry out contracts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_6">
		<text>So anything north of Limansk is Monolith territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_7">
		<text>Pretty much. There's an old hospital not far from Limansk. No point in going there - the path to the Chernobyl NPP, as well as the one leading to Yantar are both cut off by psy-emissions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_8">
		<text>Understood, thanks for the info.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="sultan_st_0">
		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_1">
		<text>Congratulations - with a memory like that, you'll be the next Strelok. Listen carefully. I'm the big dog here, and you will know my name. I got here from Zaton some time ago, along with my guys. We fucked the mutants out of the base and got it back up and running. Some sod set us up, pretended to be one of us and ratted me out. Had to get the fuck out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_2">
		<text>These rooks don't even know the rules, copping the made guys like that. Whatever that douchebag's name was, I'm going to rip him a new one.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_3">
		<text>His name was Sashenka or something - and stay out of his ass. Your prick's tiny, and his asshole is a metal maze.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_4">
		<text>Got it. Any tips on others in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_5">
		<text>Simple. Don't trust anybody but our guys with skulls on their sleeves. Pretty much everyone else is hostile - remember that. Just try to figure things out for yourself. If you feel something's off, get your ass out of there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_6">
		<text>Got it. Any safe places I can stay?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_7">
		<text>No such place as safe in the Zone, boy, but don't let this advice go to waste. North of us is the Truck Cemetery, and our boys there control the old checkpoint and the entrance to the Army Warehouses. Try not to hang around the cemetery at night, and stay away from those old irons. Radiation levels there are high enough to make your counter ring down to your balls, and I haven't even mentioned the creatures and anomalies. There's the Garbage to the west - total chaos over there. I can't say anything else, other than there's a checkpoint to the north controlled by Duty. There's a huge forest to the south called Darkscape - really wild place, you've got soldiers patrolling there from time to time and loners pissing about. Pretty big maze. Also, there are a few stalkers at the farm on the way to the Darkscape, so don't fuck around. There's a huge advantage in that forest: the road leads to the Cordon. You'll easily find our guys at the vehicle station there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_8">
		<text>That's kind of scary.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_9">
		<text>And what did you expect, boy? No sunshine and rainbows - this is the real life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_10">
		<text>Alright, whatever. Thanks for the help, boss.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="bandit_trader_st_0">
		<text>Why is your nickname so lousy?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_1">
		<text>Look who's talking! Goddamn greenhorns, trying to act all tough... You don't handle them, they can't even hold their own dicks straight when taking a piss. If you do, they act like lousy morons, to put it in your own words.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_2">
		<text>Hey, easy - didn't mean anything by it. Just didn't know what to say.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_3">
		<text>Alright, whatever... Apology accepted. Things ain't easy when you get old and your nerves are fucked.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_4">
		<text>Understood. How did you get your name?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_5">
		<text>I'll tell you, if only to put an end to your yapping. My story began under the Soviet Union, before the first time I ended up in prison. I wanted a good life... Did some trade hustle, and been caught for that one day. So after I did my time, I started making new connections and selling stolen stuff. Did that for three years before I, once again, ended up in jail. Got out, but the USSR was gone... You know what the most frustrating thing was?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_6">
		<text>No. Never saw the Soviet Union at a reasonable age.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_7">
		<text>First time I ended up in prison, it was "business"... or "profiteering", in old Soviet speech. Nowadays, anyone who's successful can end up behind bars. That place is where you feel your ass burning.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_8">
		<text>[continue...]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_9">
		<text>When I got out of my second stint, everything crashed down. No income at all, and there were loads of people around who were doing the same thing as I was. When the Zone came into existence, I figured I'd go see it for myself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_10">
		<text>[continue...]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_11">
		<text>By the way, they call me Olivius because I tend to try out the cargo people take to me firsthand. I'm keen about quality and condition.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_12">
		<text>Thanks for the history lesson. Sorry once again.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_0">
		<text>Share your story, brother.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_1">
		<text>You trying to get me prosecuted or something? Whatever, get comfortable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_2">
		<text>[continue...]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_3">
		<text>There were times when my face was constantly on a roll of honor... I worked as a mechanical engineer at a plant and got recognized in my company as the best specialist in that profession. They awarded me prizes and certificates.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_4">
		<text>I'm guessing you wanted to get some tail?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_5">
		<text>Don't interrupt me... and do pay attention to my name.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_6">
		<text>They call you Limpid because you've got something limp down under?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_7">
		<text>Real funny guy. Anyway, I enjoyed hanging out with my guys after a long shift. Had a few too many drinks... The boss caught us, and I got fired like some stupid loser.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_8">
		<text>Life's a bitch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_9">
		<text>A bitch I doubt you've seen for real. Got a job as an ordinary locksmith and found a new friend by the name of Vitka. Barely got paid jack shit, but thankfully I earned enough to get myself a few rounds once in a while. At one time we got drunk and fucked around... Don't even remember why. Anyway, I stabbed him with a screwdriver - good thing that he didn't die right then and there. Spent a few years in maximum security, and my bitch wife sold everything and ran off. When I got released, I spent all my money on drinks and ended up in the slums... Got here when the Zone came about. Here, everyone's equal: we're all outcasts. I met up with the guys at the Garbage - they found me useful as a technician and let me stay there. Best time in my life... Tons of guns and vodka.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_10">
		<text>This isn't the Garbage.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_11">
		<text>Again with your damn interrupting. The big-ass Emission happened, and we hid like little girls. When that nightmare was over with, we had a meeting on where the fuck to go: the Garbage turned out to be a bad shelter from those kinds of emissions. We had to leave it for good and move through different roads in small groups to this place - the Dark Valley.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_12">
		<text>That's quite a story.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_0">
		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_1">
		<text>Oh, I work as the technician here at the checkpoint.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_2">
		<text>What do they call you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_3">
		<text>No need for formality and ranks - not on the parade ground, at least. In case of any attack, my name would be too long to pronounce. Name's Sergey, though I prefer Seryoga.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_4">
		<text>Nice to meet you, Seryoga.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_5">
		<text>Likewise. If you need anything fixed up, just let me know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_6">
		<text>What's the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_7">
		<text>Nothing interesting. There's a stalker village a bit to the north... Nothing but hostiles all the way up to Agroprom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_8">
		<text>So... we're stuck here and in danger of being attacked at any moment?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_9">
		<text>Nah, not too long ago our commanding officers got us a BTR, reinforced our patrols, and our helicopter's always ready to go. By the way, when you leave the checkpoint northside, stay on the road. There's a minefield on both sides.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_10">
		<text>I'll keep that in mind.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="loki_st_0">
		<text>Are you in charge here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_1">
		<text>That I am. Name's Loki, right hand of Miklukha at this station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_2">
		<text>An interesting name - like the Scandinavian deity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_3">
		<text>It is. That's what they called me in the early days, right around when the Brain Scorcher showed up. Those were crazy times.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_4">
		<text>Could you tell me more about the events after the Scorcher?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_5">
		<text>Sure. When the Scorcher was shut down, my squad launched a campaign towards the north. We went on for some time, going through different places... As the Chernobyl power plant loomed on the horizon, we decided to look for a place to set up camp and found this station while it was empty. The Zone turned to hell, and Duty appeared. The places were strange, there weren't many people, and times were wild with emissions. After calling a truce, we agreed to keep all weapons holstered and knives sheathed in this station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_6">
		<text>And where is Duty now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_7">
		<text>They're not here. Anyone who we didn't manage to shoot down ran off. Not long ago, a stalker by the name of Sasha appeared and helped us out considerably - man did a lot of good things. The last piece of the puzzle he gave us was the PDA of the man who founded Duty, and according to it, he and his group were former military. Seems like he just cut off comms with the headquarters, which made local stalkers go nuts and left enemy forces confused. We kept a careful balance in this station. And thanks to the help of that stalker, we've been getting all kinds of support... from free stalkers, defectors, sympathizers, you name it. We've basically forced Duty out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_8">
		<text>And where did the stalker go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_9">
		<text>I don't know. Last time I heard, he was heading towards Jupiter with some kind of fireteam. He was a good man - hopefully he's alive and kicking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_10">
		<text>What makes the local environment dangerous?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_11">
		<text>It's full of mutants. On top of that, you've got the Monolith... Those bastards have taken over the old depot and lined the perimeter with scouts and machine guns. Other than that, some areas are crawling with zombies, such as the old village of Kopachy west of us, as well as the ventilation complex and the Volkhov AA complex. Keep your eyes peeled, man.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_12">
		<text>Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.</text>
