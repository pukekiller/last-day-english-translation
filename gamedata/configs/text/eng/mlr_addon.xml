		<text>The stalkers at the flea market have been around for a few years at this point, while we’ve only arrived here recently… though, they were dispersed by Duty because they tend to sell things considered ‘dangerous’. What a fucking joke. Apparently, they’ve somehow made an agreement. They really don’t have anything to do here. They don’t understand us, and frankly, we don’t understand them and their ideals. We hunt to survive, while they sit at their flea market like owls, collecting goodies and artefacts. Generally, those guys are pretty strange… but, eh. They’re alright.</text>

		<text>Since you’re an expert hunter, I’d like to know some more about mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_1">
		<text>There are a few cute rodents in the Zone, called ‘tushkanos’. You’ve seen them for sure. They don’t really seem dangerous, but in packs, they can easily kill even an experienced stalker. There was a case where a special detachment of Dutyers went to sweep a bloodsucker lair. Those blokes made camp somewhere in the middle of the Agroprom complex. One of the guys took off somewhere while another screwed around on his PDA. No one was keeping the night watch. Morning came, and no one was there; something was wrong. The first people to set foot in that room were in for a big surprise… The throats of the squad members had been all chewed up. Typical tushkano traces. God knows why the rodents just up and left their meal. Anyway, the rest of the soldiers decided to head to the lair and finish the job, writing off the deaths of their comrades afterwards. That’s how those men perished. Some stalker ended up retrieving their PDAs, having a new story to tell in the Bar for shits and giggles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_2">
		<text>Every rookie encounters a few dogs at the Cordon, as well as in the Great Land. They don’t really differ that much from their ‘prototypes’, so to speak; except they’re blind, but that doesn’t really keep them down, since their other senses have evolved… especially their ability to smell. They can take out newbies like fish in a barrel, and sometimes more experienced stalkers, too, mostly thanks to their mobility and swift strikes. Oi, here’s a story for you: somebody made it a habit to snatch some sausage from the Bar. Everyone raised some fuss, tore up the security, and some men from Duty even ended up keeping watch and check who was stealing. Eventually, they saw a dog run in through a hole in the fence and, naturally, shot it down. In the morning, a solemn-looking stalker comes into the Bar and asks about the dog. Barman realises what’s happening and tells him to ask the guys from Duty. Turns out the fresh-faced lad was moving to the Zone with that dead dog, who was his pet. They went though a lot. The guy was also an orphan, and then this happens to him. Ever since that moment, any wise guy who crosses the border into the Zone with a pet either keeps moving or makes dinner out of his ‘little friend’ for other stalkers… just to keep tensions low. By the way, all that sausage was actually stolen by a local alcoholic.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_3">
		<text>There are dogs, and there are pseudodogs. Why ‘pseudo’, you ask? Well, they originally evolved from wild wolves. On their own, they are easily dispatched by point blank buckshot rounds, much like ordinary wild dogs. However, a pack of pseudodogs is nothing to scoff at. Moreover, they conjure clones of themselves that swarm you… and when that happens, you need to find and kill the real one for the phantoms to stop appearing, otherwise you end up wasting precious ammo and risk getting yourself badly hurt. Those creatures are very reasonable, though, and there are even legends about, claiming they can be tamed. The Swamp Doctor’s pseudodog is an example. You can go find him if you don’t believe me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_4">
		<text>Let me tell you about snorks. The most common theory is that they’re former military personnel who guarded the Chernobyl nuclear power plant before the second explosion, when it completely fried their brains and turned them into abominations. Something like a zombie, only… even more bestial and primitive. Another theory is that they were exposed to some kind of gas prior to their change, which explains why all of them wear gas masks. When the first emission struck, it was powerful enough to vaporise anyone in the vicinity of the power plant in the blink of an eye, even collapsing underground structures, causing the substance to leak out of a secret complex or something. They crawl on all fours, claw, kick, and even pounce fairly long distances to close in on their prey. Just one is dangerous, but a group of them? Might as well off yourself right then and there. If you ever come across snorks, sidestep their pounce, then blast their ass full of lead. Heck, if you’re confident, but also have a death wish, you can kill them in midair. Good luck with that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_5">
		<text>Zombies. You know those flicks where zombies just grunt, moan, and attack with their hands? Well, it ain’t like that in Zone… sort of. Most zombies here are former stalkers, their brains completely mashed, torn, and battered by the Brain Scorcher. A lot of them still retain their speech and are also capable of operating firearms. It’s hard to understand what they’re saying most of the time. Many of them are also slaves to a controller that exploits them for various purposes, although rarely, the controller uses his ‘servants’ as food. Sakharov might be able to give you a better understanding. There’s also a more barbaric, generic type of zombie, more like the ones you see in movies. They’re slow, and not at all capable of using guns, so it should be simple to kill them… just don’t let yourself get cornered. They also feign death quite well; shoot them anywhere other than the head, and they’ll fall over and wait for your closure. It’s best to confirm the kill by putting a hole in their brains from a distance while they’re down, as they emit lots of radiation up close. According to a few documents discovered by the Marked One during his prime years, as well as a few other stalkers, the uniforms some of the more ordinary zombies wear was experimental, suggesting the zombies might’ve been something more than just working men. It’s likely they originate from laboratories and complexes, and there’s bound to be more of them located underground, so be wary.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_6">
		<text>Bloodsuckers, perhaps? Let’s see. Rumour has it they’re mutated human beings. Whether or not they mutated from the radiation after the explosions or were scientifically modified by other humans, I don’t know. What I do know, however, is that they’re one of the most dangerous predators inhabiting the Zone. Not only do they boast incredible speed, but they also camouflage themselves, making them extremely dangerous and aggressive beasts. They use stealth and circle around you, tiring your legs out, waiting for the perfect moment to strike; and when they do, it’s curtains for you. See, their name speaks for itself. They drain so much blood that by the time you unhinge those slimy feelers off your neck, you might as well be a piece of paper floating in the wind. I’ve heard stories of a stalker having committed suicide while being circled indefinitely by a bloodsucker. It’s almost like a game to them, really. When they’re not sucking your blood through a straw, their razor sharp claws come into play. Just like snorks, you can avoid their attacks, but you gotta expect it: be alert, use a shotgun, aim for the head, then fire. Rookies end up with empty mags and often fatal wounds. You’d better find a high spot or stick close to an object, keeping both of your eyes open, because the bastard will appear right before you. Keep your trigger finger on the ready and fire right as the sucker closes in. That’s the best tactic if they find you alone… Running away from them is problematic.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_7">
		<text>Burers. They are near-legendary creatures, the existence of which many don’t even want to know… Personally, I crap myself with fear just thinking about them. The best advice I can give regarding burers is to not head into dungeons or any kinds of empty complexes, laboratories in particular, because they love dwelling in such places. Recently, though, they have been sighted in pretty much every place in the Zone, and this is primarily thanks to to the actions of the Marked One, who turned off the Brain Scorcher. Chimeras too, for example, used to live closer to the centre of the Zone, but then suddenly migrated and increased their population. Apparently, someone who runs all of this in the centre of the Zone has got some influence over these creatures and is using them as a kind of Cerberus on the last approaches towards their ‘stronghold’. If you get into trouble and end up unable to escape, I’d advise you to protect your head, because they’ve got relatively powerful telekinesis powers. They can fire a focused impulse and knock you off your feet, and also take away your weapons and exhaust you, somehow influencing the gravity around you. They resemble fat, hideous dwarfs, who wear jumbo shoes with their own characteristic sounds, as well as black cloaks, strangely enough sewn almost their size. I too think that they are the result of experiments in secret laboratories. There are also different subspecies of burers, for example fire and electric, just like poltergeists. Some argue that the poltergeist is an evolutionary stage of the burer… however, if an electric poltergeist acts on you only with telekinesis, then a corresponding burer can easily throw a ball of lightning at you or even a whole Electra anomaly, the size of a substation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_8">
		<text>Controllers are no joke: those monsters emit a steady psy-background and can manipulate the consciousness of any person. It’s absolutely fatal to approach them without the right type of protection, and you’re generally better off staying away from any places they might be dwelling in. They’ll most likely just burn your brain out, not even zombifying you, in order to make some juicy grub out of you right then and there. Legend’s going around saying that they can even talk, but I don’t really believe in that. Their high level of intellect is beyond doubt, though. Sometimes they can stage clever ambushes. They often wander alone, greedy for food, or thinking about whatever goes on in that screwed-up head of theirs. A stalker once dropped by and told me and the boys that there was a weird creature that settled down around Rostok. He went to have a look, but was stopped by a sudden, severe headache that almost made him drop his gun, so he backed off, thinking it was just radiation. The rest of us went with him to scoop the place out. We came in, and I also felt a headache! Later, we went back prepared, having taken some special pills that basically got rid of any emotions in our body. I looked around and saw a man-shaped figure sitting in the darkness. I opened fire, but it disappeared, and then, the bastard came out behind my back, and I shot him. Then I heard a faint, yet familiar voice… and couldn’t believe it. I had shot down my friend Vasyuk. Eventually we managed to get rid of that mutant freak, but I quit hunting ever since and ended up opening a bar here. I was fortunate not to get killed. Redhead was a smart guy, so he took off to the north after what happened.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_9">
		<text>And the cats… Have you seen those things? Oh, god. Only this place can turn pets into feral beasts. Their whole thyroid is swollen from all the radiation, along with tumours located inside their cheeks. I don’t really know why those cats have become like this. They’ve grown in size with sharper claws, and they run like crazy. People usually have to get domestic cats down from trees; here, you’re the one who gets chased around. To make matters worse, they’ve developed a pack mentality similar to dogs and wolves. They’re wild and they can be found anywhere in the Zone, so keep an eye on your surroundings at all times. They come running, and if you aren’t careful, they will cling onto your ass and have a nice, tasty bite.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_10">
		<text>Not many people here believe in the paranormal, and everyone has their own faith. Some people believe in their own strength, some believe in their leaders, and some believe in alien intervention… but certainly not in God. However, there is still a monster by the name of ‘poltergeist’, because how else would you describe a translucent flying abomination that throws objects at you? Still, there’s pretty much nothing in common between the mutant and the type of entity in folklore. You can kill it in quite ordinary ways. It doesn’t react to salt—we had a poor bastard that tried it—and takes the appearance of a flying electric anomaly, or, less commonly, a fire essence. The electric one loves showering you with all sorts of random rubbish, just like a burer, but the fire one is somehow able to create a jet of fire right in front of your face, similar in effect to a geyser and extremely hot. Shoot directly into the essence; you won’t miss, but it is very difficult to kill because of its speed and manoeuvrability. In a few cases, stalkers have spotted some kind of black or smoky poltergeist. Nothing certain is known about its properties, but it’s quite a rare specimen, and probably so because meeting with it means death in the vast majority of cases. It’s even more difficult to kill because of its smoke that’s harder to trace. Thus, aiming and shooting at its core is more difficult.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_11">
		<text>There are also creatures whose tales are told in front of campfires. They are called fractures. Humanoid creatures with hypertrophic arms and necks, they possess an abnormal hand that can break a person’s chest, while the other is more often than not normal, without any anomalous property. There are a lot of stories about the fact that Fractures often like to come into contact with stalkers and ask for all kinds of crap, anywhere from cans to imported toothpaste. If you aren’t lucky and don’t have what it asks of you, then prepare for a fight or a certain death… in particular death, because fractures often come into contact with the upper hand; for example, if you happen to be alone and he’s already holding you from behind with his bucketed hand. If you do have what it asks of you, don’t hand it over rushedly; rather, move away from it quietly and on all fours. That way, you won’t get harmed. Anyway, those are all stories… who really knows. Some even leave provisions in places where fractures have been spotted, in vain hopes to drive them off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_12">
		<text>Here’s another one: the pseudogiant. Usually, its height never exceeds that of a human’s… however, its huge hands can cause very strong shock waves, which is how it earned its name. Until recently, nothing about it was known, and it is most likely another of those abominations from the laboratories, thanks to the underground bellends who love to rummage around every single complex, not closing any doors behind them. To the north, there was some kind of military guy who never shut the door at some facility… at the Iron Forest in Zaton, I believe. Since then, these giants have been observed even in the vicinity of the Jupiter plant. By observing some of its features, it is possible to determine that ‘it’ was once a man, such as the small, hanging arms in front of the main ones, its skin, and a few other peculiar characteristics. It’s got some sharp teeth, but don’t worry about that, because it’s more likely to just knock you down and crush you. And don’t take its awkward appearance into account, because it never falls down and never goes astray. The best thing to do before venturing near an area where a pseudogiant has been spotted is to grab a couple of rifle grenades and a machine gun, as the skin and bones of the mutant have shown excellent resistance to small arms, and the creature itself is very resilient.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_13">
		<text>The chimera can rightfully be considered at the top of the food chain in the Zone. How come? It is a very clever creature: a nocturnal predator that can pounce at you with a single jump from a distance of several tens of metres. Four-legged mutant, has two heads, for which it has received its nickname. It is also very durable and has sharp claws, capable of tearing through even the skin of a pseudogiant. It lets out a characteristic roar while jumping, frighteningly similar to a person’s. They’ve have mainly been encountered in the northern parts of the Zone, in open places near facilities or complexes. As told by local hunter Trapper, they have their own sphere of influence, where they rest and hunt during late at night. There is also a subspecies, namely the black chimera. It cannot be seen at all in the dark, which makes it much more dangerous than its relatives, as the usual ones have almost human skin colour. It is also said to be stronger and more enduring. Escaping from a chimera is practically impossible. It’s better to find a narrow room that will hamper its manoeuvrability, or try to jump aside while it leaps at you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_14">
		<text>Wild boars and flesh. The latter are an example of a terribly mutated pig, as proven by scientists. Those creatures are rather sluggish and weak, and only a complete muppet could get under its bladed paws, which will penetrate virtually any armour. As for boars, differ little from their relatives outside the Zone, apart from the fact that they are larger and more dangerous… Oh, and their hooves are much stronger, cutting through fabric and human flesh effortlessly. It’s enough just to jump aside and move somewhere in a couple of metres when these beasts rush at you, to avoid their fangs. Oftentimes, stalkers like to meat of wild boars and flesh alike, but not without treating it beforehand to avoid radiation poisoning.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_15">
		<text>Karliks… Thanks for helping me gather information about them. Here’s what I’ve jotted down: they mainly reside in underground complexes, most of which have previously been used for experiments on people. Apparently, karliks are the result of such experiments. They possess supernatural strength, good speed, and attack most often in groups. At the moment, only one subspecies has been discovered: smoked ones. They’re nasty buggers mutated by anomalies, and they emit dangerous radiation. Best not to go near them without a Wrenched or a Bubble in your pocket.</text>

The path to Yantar is cut off because of the psy-installation, and crowds of zombies sometimes come out of there, along with mutants. Limansk has gone to shit; it’s a maze full of dangers. The Red Forest is even more dangerous, since Monolith fighters have settled at the bridge to Limansk while the rest of the area is crawling with mutants. ring id="bandit_main_base_medic_mlr_heal_0"></text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_2">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_3">
		<text>As for any dangers, you’ll see those for yourself. Keep in mind, though: when carrying out orders, you’ve got a job to do, and any emotions are just gonna distract you. Just put those aside. There’s no room for emotion, no room for morality, only intellect and calculation. And regarding other paths, the safest route is through Limansk. There’s plenty of closed space where you’ll be safe from sniper fire, and you can hide from firefights as well as anomalies in shelter located around the city. The area’s generally quite unpredictable, however. You can never know what exactly’s around the corner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_4">
		<text>You say that this base is central. Does that mean there are any other outposts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_5">
		<text>There are two minor ones that I know of. The first one is in Zaton, at the edge of the southern marshes. The second one is in the southwest part of the Pripyat outskirts. We’ve also got a group stationed in the Wild Territory, and you can find our squads in different parts of the Zone when they carry out contracts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_6">
		<text>So anything north of Limansk is Monolith territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_7">
		<text>Pretty much. There’s an old hospital not far from Limansk, and there’s absolutely no point in going there. The path to the Chernobyl NPP, as well as the one leading to Yantar are both cut off by psy-emissions. After you reach Limansk, stay on the southern road, and make sure you’ve got some supplies with you.</text>

		<text>Life’s a bitch.</text>

		<text>The bitch that all of us have to put up with. Got a job as an ordinary locksmith and found a new friend by the name of Vitka. Barely got paid jack shit, but thankfully I earned enough to get myself a few rounds once in a while. At one time we got drunk and pissed around; don’t even remember why. Anyway, I stabbed him with a screwdriver. Good thing that he didn’t die right then and there. Spent a few years in maximum security while my bitch wife sold everything and ran off. When I got released, I spent all my money on drinks and ended up in the slums. Got here when the Zone came about. Here, everyone’s equal. We’re all outcasts. I met up with the blokes at the Garbage. They found me useful as a technician and let me stay there. Best time in my life… Tons of guns and vodka.</text>

		<text>Again with your damn interrupting. The big-arse Emission happened, and we hid like little girls.

		<text>I’ll tell you, if only to put an end to your yapping. My story began under the Soviet Union, before the first time I ended up in prison. I wanted a good life. Did some trading and hustling, and been caught for that one day. So after I did my time, I started making new connections and selling stolen stuff. Did that for three years before I, once again, ended up in jail. Got out, but the USSR was gone… You know what the most frustrating thing was?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_6">
		<text>No. Never saw the Soviet Union at a reasonable age.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_7">
		<text>First time I ended up in prison, it was ‘business’… or ‘profiteering’, in old Soviet speech. These days, anyone who’s successful can end up behind bars. That place is where you feel your arse burn.</text>

	<string id="bandit_trader_st_9">
		<text>When I got out of my second stint, everything crashed down. No income at all, and there were loads of people around who were doing the same thing as me. When the Zone came into existence, I figured I’d go see it for myself.</text>

There have been constant disputes about what they really are, but old satellite images suggests some kind of weird infrastructure, in whose honour the entire area was named. Apparently, that’s the place the Monolith carry out their orders and all important procedures regarding the territory of the Zone. So the stalker’s already gone there, and I think he’s serious.

	<string id="devushka_1_start_0">
		<text>Hey, what’s up, dude?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_1_start_1">
		<text>Not bad. And you… How did you come here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_1_start_2">
		<text>I was with Freedom, but I ended up leaving them. I had my reasons… Will you help me? I only have one PM left, and I would love to have some kind of shotgun, preferably from the TOZ family - I’m pretty used to them. Somehow I think I’ve seen a TOZ with optics around. Yes, and 20 ammo for it to begin with, I think that’s enough.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_1_start_3">
		<text>Yeah, let me help you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_1_start_4">
		<text>No. I have better things to do.</text>
	</string>

		<string id="devushka_1_start_6">
			<text>After I’ve made it deep in the Zone, how about I make it deep inside of you?</text>
		</string>

	<string id="devushka_1_start_5">
		<text>Thank you. I have something for you.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_2_start_0">
		<text>Here you go. Found you this gun. And buckshots. Why didn’t you buy the ammo from Sidorovich though?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_start_1">
		<text>Thanks dude. Yes, Sid wants to send me out of the Zone, you see I don’t belong here, I need to go home to my mother. She’s right, but someone has to feed her granddaughter. Here, take it, as promised - it will come in handy! Rummaging around here, I stumbled upon an old cache of the local equipment.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_0_dialog_0">
		<text>So, how’s it going? You look kind of sick, to be honest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_0_dialog_1">
		<text>Yes, it’s just that I haven’t been eating for quite a while now. Listen, is there anything to eat? I can definitely feel my belly sticking to my back. If you have some canned food…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_0_dialog_2">
		<text>Here you go, I don’t mind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_0_dialog_3">
		<text>I’m so sorry, but with very tight supplies around here, there’s nothing to eat.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_0_dialog_4">
		<text>Give her something to eat, look for a weapon, buy cartridges for her…. Can’t you do something on your own? Freedomer scum…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_0_dialog_5">
		<text>Respect, dude. Thank you for all.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_1_dialog_0">
		<text>Tell me about yourself again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_1_dialog_1">
		<text>Yes what can I tell you… My family was completely dysfunctional, a total mess. My mother drank and had sex with bolsheviks, I never knew my father, and my stepfather was an asshole, he beat me up all the time. Once, after another beating, he wanted to rape me, I did not give up and broke a bottle on his head. I hated him so much that in a fit of anger I stabbed him with a piece. When I snapped out of it, my hands were drenched in blood, my stepfather was no longer breathing, and there was nothing to do for him… I had to escape, I really did not want to go to jail.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_1_dialog_2">
		<text>That’s rough… And you went into the Zone like this, alone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_1_dialog_3">
		<text>No, I had a friend… She was called Sprat. We went to the Zone together, she had a guy here who was a Freedomer. But poor Sprat didn’t survive, she got killed by an anomaly. I brought her bag to the guy, he was cool, nobody would touch me. He was a good man, he grieved deeply for her. He then got shot by some Duty fucker and all kind of scum started harassing me. I got out of there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_1_dialog_4">
		<text>I understand.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_heal_0">
		<text>Wait, let me help you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_heal_1">
		<text>Come on, I’m fine. Don’t worry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_heal_2">
		<text>Someone promised to do what I say, rookie. Remember?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_heal_3">
		<text>Right? Look, if you need anything - just holler.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_heal_4">
		<text>I know, I know… Thanks.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_0">
		<text>What do you plan to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_1">
		<text>Why, I asked Sidorovich for a job, to search for artefacts. Why are you asking? Do you want to help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_2">
		<text>Well. I have to go. Good luck, Hip.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_3">
		<text>Wha—you can’t just leave me here! How am I going to do without you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_4">
		<text>What are you so upset about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_5">
		<text>Man, don’t go, please. Don’t leave me… I feel so safe around you, you’re the only one I can trust in this misery.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_6">
		<text>You should go home, Hip. Let me talk to Sidorovich, he can help smuggle you across the border. Your parents must be going crazy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_7">
		<text>They only go crazy if I don’t make enough money to get their fucking booze! My family was completely dysfunctional, a total mess. My mother drank and had sex with bolsheviks, I never knew my father, and my stepfather was an asshole, he beat me up all the time. Once, after another beating, he wanted to rape me, I did not give up and broke a bottle on his head. I hated him so much that in a fit of anger I stabbed him with a piece.

	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_8">
		<text>That’s rough… And you went into the Zone like this, alone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_9">
		<text>No, I had a friend… She was called Kulka. We went to the Zone together, she had a guy here who was a Freedomer. But poor Kulka didn’t survive, she got killed by an anomaly. I brought her bag to the guy, he was cool, nobody would touch me. He was a good man, he grieved deeply for her. He then got shot by some Duty fucker and all kind of scum started harassing me. I got out of there. I don’t have anyone now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_10">
		<text>And what should I do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_11">
		<text>Help me with my task, tell me how to survive in the Zone… You’re a tough stalker, cool, you know a lot. I’ll do anything! Don’t leave me alone! You’re the coolest, you… You are the first actual human being that I met here.</text>
	</string>

		<string id="devushka_2_dialog_16">
			<text>Do you have any idea what it’s like to crawl through the Zone? How it is at night, for example, in the Darkscape, and not in a cozy village for newcomers under the supervision of Fanatic? Did you ever flee from a pack of blind dogs in an unfamiliar terrain, where there are more anomalies than a fool of candy wrappers? No? And look at the zombies. They roam around like a fucking freakshow; handsome boys, right? Keep in mind, the same thing can happen to your pretty face.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="devushka_2_dialog_17">
			<text>Yeah that’s cool. I’m strong and smart. I can take it, don’t worry if I’m a girl. Take me with you, stalker. You can always kick me out later, we got plenty of time.</text>
		</string>

	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_12">
		<text>Oh… All right, all right. Lesson one: forget that you were in Freedom. Any further trip is going to be without any Freedom stuff and their idiotic catchphrases! Well, then tear off all their patches and insignias, we can’t have Dutiers flocking around thinking that you are one of those stoners. Which artefacts do we need? Do you have a detector?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_13">
		<text>Sorry, Hip, but no.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_14">
		<text>A Moonlight, a Fireball and a Wrenched. I’ve got one, it’s an Echo.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_2_dialog_15">
		<text>Well, that’s better than nothing… Will do, but you’ll need a more functional one to get your hands on those artefacts. Come on rookie, let’s move out!</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_3_quest_0">
		<text>Sidorovich, I’ve helped Hip with your assignment, here’s the goods.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_1">
		<text>Hmm. Well, okay, the deal is a deal. I will not go into your business with her, I do not need it for 100 years. Here’s some money, for all the work. Don’t forget to give some to her. Wait. And yet … While you two were searching for artefacts, a couple of Freedomers came to the village, asked around for Hip. But I said that I’ve never heard of someone like her. I know it’s not your fault, but it is better for her to leave the village quietly. If they come back again it’s gonna get ugly for her and for you, they’ll wipe out any witness, and I really don’t want to undermine Freedom’s trust.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_2">
		<text>Damn, so much trouble. All right, we’ll leave at night, no noise and no dust. Thanks for having our backs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_3">
		<text>You did the same after all, deciding to look after her. And if that girl would disappear in the Zone, that surely would be a pity.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_3_quest_money_0">
		<text>Here you go, your honest half of the reward.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_money_1">
		<text>My first serious earnings! Thank you so much!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_3_dialog_0">
		<text>Here, Sidorovich told me that some Freedomers came here for you. Sidor did not betray us, but now we have to leave this place. Now go, have a rest, we are leaving at night, I’ll think about how we should plan all this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_dialog_1">
		<text>Oh, I was hoping they’d finally leave me alone, fucking bastards, even here. Okay, let’s leave tonight…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_dialog_2">
		<text>Let’s go by the fire and take a rest for a while.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_4_dialog_0">
		<text>Sit quiet here, don’t go anywhere. I’ll come for you tonight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_dialog_1">
		<text>Ok, I’ll be here, waiting for you.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_4_quest_0">
		<text>Hey, how are you? Ready? I’ve got a few ideas about what we’re gonna do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_1">
		<text>Ready, I think… What are we gonna do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_2">
		<text>I think that we should turn to Barman, who lives in the 100 Rads bar, he will tell us what to do. I don’t like Freedomers and I don’t want to confront them head on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_3">
		<text>I think that the Freedom guys are decent people and we will be able to find an agreement together. Let’s go to the Army Warehouses to Miklukha and decide everything. Don’t worry, I can protect you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_4">
		<text>OK, let’s go. I, too, do not want to drag myself to the Army Warehouses to see these scum again, who dared to grope me everywhere.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_5">
		<text>Okay … Miklukha, of course, I think he’s the most suitable among those bastards. I’m not worried.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_4_help_0">
		<text>Good day. What’s up? There are a couple of issues with my partner, some problems with Freedom…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_help_1">
		<text>Well come in, here, have a cup on the house, and a treat for the lady! Things are going fine. Problems with Freedom, you say? I’m aware of, about your problems. Women in the Zone are so rare, that news about them spread more quickly than wildfire. Your Hip is looking for a few scumbags, because of which she probably left Freedom. I can contact Lukash and fix everything, he’ll be there in a flash to put them in line, but as they say, you scratch my back, I scratch yours.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_5_help_0">
		<text>Good day. How’s it going? There are a couple of questions about my partner, I think you know her.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_5_help_1">
		<text>Well, come here, there you go, bro. Relax. Things are going well, even though the evil spirits that were hiding from the Barrier have not diminished. And of course, I know about Hip. She sure caused a commotion among all the groups. Some of my guys even battered each other’s faces because of her.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_help_0">
		<text>What does your request involve?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_help_1">
		<text>Oh, a mere trifle. Take these containers for artefacts to Beard at the Skadovsk. He often stores highly radioactive artefacts, and sometimes without proper containment the place there radiates like the Chernobyl NPP. Keep in mind, they’re heavy. Will you do that for me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_help_2">
		<text>Can do, give me your containers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_help_3">
		<text>Wait, we need to prepare for this.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_help1_0">
		<text>A couple of your guys came in the Rookie Village, chasing after Hip , looking for her. Do you know anything about this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_help1_1">
		<text>A couple of guys, you say? Hmm… I have an idea who it might be. In other matters, I will deal with them, do not worry. It was not enough that Freedom became famous because it ravages defenseless girls. Although Hip has a pair of scorpions up her sleeves, you surely can’t call her defenseless. But, dude, you are also in debt with us, since you took an excellent shot from my group. Relax, relax, don’t get angry, I’m joking. Can you deliver these goods to Loki in Yanov? There are a couple of bags with medicines. We’ll properly reward you. Will you do it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_help1_2">
		<text>Why wouldn’t we, since you so willingly helped us. Give us your medicines.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_help1_3">
		<text>Wait, we need to prepare a little first.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_boroda_help_0">
		<text>Hello. How is it going? We came with some presents from Barman, here’s your containers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_boroda_help_1">
		<text>Hey. Well thank you for the delivery, here’s a couple of souvenirs.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_loki_help_0">
		<text>Hello there. How’s life, man? We have come to you bearing gifts from Miklukha, here’s your medicine supply.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_loki_help_1">
		<text>Hi. Thanks, man. Here’s a bonus, Mikluha ordered it.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="give_devushka_medved_0">
		<text>Hey, rookie. Here, take this good detector, it’s a lot better than your Echo.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_devushka_medved_1">
		<text>Thanks, now I’m sure I’ll find something cool!</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_give_present_0">
		<text>Well, that’s all. One less problem pressing on our shoulders, although in the process of solving it we were brought to the north of the Zone. It is extremely dangerous, much more dangerous than in the southern areas, but you can get some very nice loot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_1">
		<text>artefacts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_2">
		<text>Yes, but those for which scientists are willing to pay a lot of money. It’s not like those three simple artefact that Sidorovich asked you to bring him. We need a special detector here. But there’s also a whole lot of more common ones.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_3">
		<text>Wow! So, shall we go look for some?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_4">
		<text>You know what, rookie… We have to put an end to our life in the Zone, you and me. It’s alien to us, this godforsaken Zone, only the undead, bloodsuckers and other vermin can live here, it’s not a place for living, breathing people.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_5">
		<text>How so? Why? We won’t look for artefacts anymore? And I’m not a stalker?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_6">
		<text>What has stalking ever gave you. What’s good about it? Playing a game of cards with death every day? Newsflash, lassie, everyone falls down playing it. And we’re doing this for what? Pocket change? Yes damn it to hell, this dirt, this foul place. Scratching some kind of itch? You have to understand, there’s death at every turn, around every corner, I’m sick of her.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_7">
		<text>You’re worried for me, aren’t you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_8">
		<text>Yes, of course I am. I don’t want you to be a stalker.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_9">
		<text>I do not know what you thought of this while we were here. But it seems to me that you are already drawn to the Zone. After all, once a stalker, always a stalker. The same goes for me too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_10">
		<text>Well, then look for another teacher.</text>
	</string>

		<string id="devushka_give_present_12">
			<text>Whatever you say.</text>
		</string>

	<string id="devushka_give_present_11">
		<text>Oh, what are you doing to me? Well… let’s take a breather, we’ll then see what’s interesting around here. I bet you’ve never seen anything like it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_13">
		<text>Wait, I got something for you. This is for you! And yet, if suddenly you want to be alone - take me to the Rookie Village, I’ll be waiting for you there. Sure, I’d prefer to stay with you, but you’re the one calling the shots here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_14">
		<text>Well well! Aye yes, rookie. When did you have time to find this? I’ve always kept you close… You learn fast!</text>
	</string>



	<string id="devushka_go_village_0">
		<text>Rookie, I’ll leave you for a while. Don’t worry, it’s not forever.</text>

	<string id="devushka_go_village_1">
		<text>Are you sure?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_go_village_2">

		<text>No, it’s not a virus. The very first stalkers who managed to get to the mythical Monolith - the Wishgranter, buried somewhere in the bowels of the fourth power unit of the Chernobyl NPP, became Ghosts of the Zone. The Monolith supposedly really made their dream come true, but always with some tricks. Yuri Semetsky - one of the first stalkers who set foot on the contaminated land back in 2007, - according to a legend, got to the Wishgranter and ordered nothing less than eternal life for himself.</text>

Now he’s just sitting there, absolutely devastated by what happened. It was his first artefact, and they call it a Battery. I would go look for it myself, but I can’t leave the rookies alone.

	<string id="hunter_gar_trader_task_2_fetch_finish">
		<text>Excellent work, hunter.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_0">
		<text>Are you another bandit?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_1">
		<text>Heh, no. I’m not a bandit, and I won’t shoot unless you give me a good reason to. I’m a hunter by trade, but I wouldn’t put it past anyone in the Zone to mistake me for a bandit. Those pigs just happened to be around until you showed up to take care of them. As you can see, I manage a small, cosy, and generally safe bar… well, safe for the most part. By the way, name’s Butcher.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_2">
		<text>So you’re an artefact hunter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_3">
		<text>Eh, not quite. We don’t collect artefacts, we don’t adhere to any common views on the Zone, and we certainly don’t try to unravel its secrets. Our job is to hunt mutants, and not because they represent a threat, as Duty seems to wholeheartedly believe, but because of the thrill of the hunt. Many of us were former hunters, both amateurs and professionals outside of the Zone. Many perished, as they weren’t prepared for the level of… unpredictability the Zone showed them. Oh, and the trenchcoat; you’ll come to understand that such outfits are quite ideal for hunting, as the mobility they offer is certainly useful. We also try to stay out of any armed conflicts between other groups of stalkers, and the coats help us stand out in that regard, acting as an unofficial uniform of sorts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_4">
		<text>I see. Well, you work at a bar. Do you have anything for sale?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_5">
		<text>I do, though my stock is nothing special. Some stalkers bring mutant parts to me and I sell them. I also have a few other goods, like provisions, medicine, and equipment. And if you’re up for hunting mutants for coin, I’ve got a few jobs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hunter_trader_meet_6">
		<text>I’ll keep that in mind.</text>

		<text>I’ve heard a lot about you guys, but I wasn’t sure it was true. Tell me about your faction.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="in_freedom_1">
		<text>Not to toot my own horn, but we’re actually one of the strongest factions in the Zone, heh. We control and guard the Barrier, and we try to prevent those Duty assholes from coming here, because the goals we have are, in fact, very different. We want to co-exist with the Zone, in the best sense of the word - we believe that it is a gift to humanity. You ask how? Look around! This whole place is like a fairy tale. Anomalies that violently violate the laws of physics and creatures with amazing ‘properties’, none of which I believe should be wiped out. Perhaps they can somehow coexist with us, or maybe we can at least borrow something from them. Nevertheless, we don’t recognize the ‘official’ approach to the Zone. Scientists may be doing a noble job, sure, but, like… All that stuff is gonna be kept by oligarchs, so what’s left for common folk, you know? We just want to share the wonders of the Zone with the public, so that people won’t be afraid of what they hear from the mainstream media. Instead, they’ll start respecting it. Can you imagine how we, and only we, can advance in development? And what’s worse is that the heads of the government can potentially develop some kind of weapon if they understand the psy-stuff that goes on around here. Anyway, we have no rules here, but discipline is still needed for banal survival, so during operations, our fighters obey the commands of the senior and experienced stalkers in the detachment. But all this is nothing more than a necessity. Are you interested in joining? We’re always in need of stalkers who share our vision.</text>

		<text>Are you in charge here?</text>

		<text>That I am. Name’s Loki, right hand of Miklukha at this station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_2">
		<text>An interesting name. It’s like the Scandinavian deity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_3">
		<text>That’s what it is. It’s what they called me in the early days, right around when the Brain Scorcher showed up. Those were crazy times.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_4">
		<text>Could you tell me more about the events after the Scorcher?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_5">
		<text>Sure. When the Scorcher was shut down, my squad launched a campaign towards the north. We went on for some time, going through different places… As the Chernobyl power plant loomed on the horizon, we decided to look for a place to set up camp and found this station while it was empty. The Zone turned to hell, and Duty appeared. The places were strange, there weren’t many people, and times were wild with emissions. After calling a truce, we agreed to keep all weapons holstered and knives sheathed in this station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_6">
		<text>And where is Duty now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_7">
		<text>They’re not here. Anyone who we didn’t manage to shoot down ran off. Not long ago, a stalker by the name of Sasha appeared and helped us out considerably. The man did a lot of good things. The last piece of the puzzle he gave us was the PDA of the man who founded Duty, and according to it, he and his group were former military. Seems like he just cut off comms with the headquarters, which made local stalkers go nuts and left enemy forces confused. We kept a careful balance in this station. And thanks to the help of that stalker, we’ve been getting all kinds of support, from free stalkers, defectors, sympathisers, you name it. We’ve basically forced Duty out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_8">
		<text>And where did the stalker go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_9">
		<text>I don’t know. Last I heard, he was heading towards Jupiter with some kind of fireteam. He was a good man, hopefully he’s alive and kicking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_10">
		<text>What makes the local environment dangerous?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_11">
		<text>It’s full of mutant. On top of that, you’ve got the Monolith, who have completely taken over the old depot. Other than that, some areas are crawling with zombies, such as the old village of Kopachy west of us, along with the ventilation complex and the Volkhov AA complex. Keep your eyes peeled, mate.</text>

	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_1_2_1">
		<text>So I’ve heard - well done. You’re a good fighter and I trust you, so I’ll give you what you need. The boys have probably told you about the assault at that damned bridge in Limansk. In case you don’t know… Back then, in the city - as well as the surrounding area in the Red Forest - mercenaries were in charge of everything. Of course, they aren’t going to just lower the bridge for you, but there is a live participant in those events - they call him Forester. It was him, along with Scar, who somehow agreed that a group of ‘standards’ would lower the bridge while our fighters protected them from the other shore. Here, I’ll give you info on a route between the Army Warehouses and the Red Forest - use it to find Forester and talk to him. And here’s a reward for the bloodsucker cleanup.</text>

		<text>…I saw something in Scar; the Zone needed him. You, however… Yes, I’d like to know what happened to him. So, listen: we helped the mercenary detachment get out of the space anomaly. Once everything was settled, they paid me a visit. Looks like one of them snitched on me, told them I also took part in the rescue. I spoke to their leader, Leshiy, who gave me some provisions, money, and ammunition, and then he went on his way. In his own words, he headed off to the army warehouses; to Freedom. You can go look for him there. Several years have passed, but judging by our conversation, his intentions to join them were serious.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="look_for_cs_history_part_3_2_5">
		<text>Hm. You gotta understand that I haven’t been part of the Syndicate for a long time… Not even sure who runs the group at the bridge. I’ve got a few connections, but I’m gonna need some time for this… and some money. One hundred and fifty thousand, no less.</text>

I’m not a real soldier, so they put me here in Yantar… Anyway, they call me Rookie; not far from the truth. Usually, I take to drinking because it’s so depressing around here. If that ain’t enough, this is the main base of the scientists, meaning my officers come here for inspections from time to time, and they don’t really fancy seeing alcohol… Last time they were here, they poured my vodka out right before my eyes.

I’ve also got a few outfits; everything I’ve managed to steal is mine. What do you say about trading with me for a few bottles of Cossacks? For five bottles, I can offer you four 9x18 mags or two mags of 5.45. For ten bottles, I can share four mags of 5.45 or one mag of 7.62mm 7N1, and for twenty bottles, I’ll fetch you an entire Berill suit from the bins… Don’t think I’m a scoundrel. It’s not that bad, and the lion’s share goes to the guys. They’ve left me their equipment in a stash. I’ll leave any goods between the hangars outside the bunker.</text>

A squad of experienced stalkers went MIA, and after that another squad stumbled upon some Monolith near the sawmill, from what I heard.

		<text>I serve as a medic. I went out on a contract here and was almost immediately assigned to the Fairway group after some preparation. We were somehow stuck in Pripyat after the collapse of the operation… Well, those of us who were still alive… Then a man from the USS helped us, and then they evacuated us. I still can’t get this one case out of my head: our commander sent me and a couple of guys to the kindergarten, in which—according to preliminary data—there was a device that interfered with radio communications. I don’t know what came over me, and I wasn’t feeling myself: I couldn’t see, I didn’t know where my comrades were, and something pulled a veil straight over my eyes. Right in that kindergarten, I found a damn refrigerator and hid in there. Then, I heard an explosion right above me, and I immediately felt better for whatever reason, but the refrigerator locked up and I couldn’t get out without outside help. I don’t recall if I locked myself in it or if it was a poltergeist that held the door closed…</text>

	<string id="story_b_cs_2">
		<text>How did he earn that respect?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_3">
		<text>You see, there was some controversy regarding Lebedev, our former leader—who, by the way, I personally never met—and he didn’t seem to take the opinions of the faction members into account during their reckless crusade towards the CNPP. That mercenary certainly helped us out, but in the end, it just wasn’t worth it. Those who remained at the base were unable to fight back against a resurgence made by the renegades. The significance of our struggle in the swamps was reduced to zero… and the sacrifices here and on the way to the Chernobyl NPP turned out to be in vain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_4">
		<text>It seems like the faction’s resentment towards their leader at that time was justified.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_5">
		<text>There’s more to it. After our troops managed to return, we had to start a long conflict to take everything back. We wouldn’t be able to manage in day-to-day life without Cold. He rallied up a number of unaffiliated stalkers and got in touch with folks throughout the Garbage and the Cordon. Free stalkers helped us out, and having a charismatic leader certainly didn’t hurt. Moreover, he’s given an order to all fighters, without exceptions, not to leave this place. We’ll take any help, but we won’t continue risking the lives of our guys.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Things are quiet with Freedom. Of course, there’s no chance in hell we’re leaving them alone; gotta keep our guard up. Other than that, the bandits aren’t particularly dangerous. The Blues Brothers to the west and northwest aren’t as interested in us as much as we are in them, but there’s no way to be sure. Again, gotta keep your eyes peeled, especially when they’re carrying out any operations. Other groups and clans don’t pose any threat, with the exception of the Monolith. It seems to me that something’s out there, and it can’t be any good. Fortunately, Freedom’s the one who has to worry about any border attacks by those fanatics.</text>

	<string id="story_dolg_3">
		<text>Solid three out of five; decent. What’s good is the shaky stability in terms of fighters and their influx, people are going, so not everything is lost. What’s bad is that the control of the territories at the southern approaches to the eastern part of Pripyat; we couldn’t hold on to the Yanov station. The southern approaches to the Bar are constantly under attack by bandits and mutants, and they are sometimes pushed by the mercs from the east.</text>

I prefer tinkering with heavy firearms and assault weapons… Hate working on marksman rifles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_2">
		<text>What’s with the bottles? Didn’t think Duty allowed for drinking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_3">
		<text>Duty lets me drink on duty… he-he. Bloody hell, it’s hard getting by without a few bottles… The work is pretty damn tedious, and boring. I wish I could go back to the Agroprom, but our base there is gone now. I don’t even know if I’d be alive if they had never relocated me. They say the base was lost during an emission in 2011… Huh, looks like we’ve gone way off topic. Anyway, don’t be shy now. Show me your toys if you need ’em fixed.</text>

	<string id="sultan_st_0">
		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_1">
		<text>Congratulations! With a memory like that, you’ll be the next Strelok. Now listen carefully. I’m the big dog here, and you will know my name. I got here from Zaton some time ago along with my guys. We fucked the mutants out of the base and got it back up and running. Some sod set us up, pretended to be one of us and ratted me out. Had to get the hell out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_2">
		<text>These rooks don’t even know the rules, copping the made guys like that. Whatever that twat’s name was, I’m gonna rip him a new one.</text>

		<text>His name was Sashenka or something, and stay out of his ass. Your prick can’t be any larger than my pinky, and his asshole’s a metal maze.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_4">
		<text>Got it. Any tips on other groups in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_5">
		<text>Simple. Don’t trust anybody but our guys with skulls on their sleeves. Pretty much everyone else is hostile; remember that. Just try to figure things out for yourself. If you feel something’s off, get your arse out of there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_6">
		<text>Got it. Any safe places I can stay?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_7">
		<text>No such thing as a safe place in the Zone, boy, but don’t let this advice go to waste. North of us is the truck cemetery, and our boys there control the old checkpoint and the entrance to the army warehouses. Try not to hang around the cemetery at night, and stay away from all the old vehicles. Radiation levels there are high enough to make your counter ring down to your goolies, and that’s not even mentioning the creatures and anomalies. There’s the Garbage to the west; total chaos over there, and there’s a checkpoint to the north controlled by Duty. South of us is a forest called the Darkscape. Really wild place. You’ve got soldiers patrolling there from time to time and loners pissing about. Pretty big maze. Also, there are a few stalkers at the farm on the way to the Darkscape, so don’t fuck around. There’s a huge advantage in that forest: the road leads to the Cordon. You’ll easily find our guys at the vehicle station there.</text>

	<string id="svarog_1_dialog_0">
		<text>Professor, do you have any new inventions that will help me survive in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svarog_1_dialog_1">
		<text>Yes, young man. My long stay in this bunker in the middle of this marsh is paying off. But all the devices and medicines I have developed are almost singular. Eh, if I had more resources… The previous group of stalkers, who went after the artefacts, disappeared. The second group is not very experienced, and so far there is not much help from them. I can not entrust a new detector to them…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svarog_1_dialog_2">
		<text>A new detector?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svarog_1_dialog_3">
		<text>Well, again let it out. Oh, my gray head. Yes, I received two Svarog detectors, which my colleagues invented from the vicinity of Jupiter. I gave one of them to my research group, in return they brought me artefacts with incredible properties.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svarog_1_dialog_4">
		<text>Can I buy this detector?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svarog_1_dialog_5">
		<text>Sorry, but it is the only one and therefore not for sale. And I do not have parts for self-manufacturing. Moreover, even though you are an experienced stalker, I do not know you at all. I’m sorry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svarog_1_dialog_6">
		<text>I can help get you new parts, for making a detector, if you agree to sell it to me later.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svarog_1_dialog_7">
		<text>Well, in that case, I’ll need parts of the rare mutants. Let’s start with this one. Bring me 4 hands of a controller, 4 hands of a burer, 4 tentacles of a bloodsucker, 4 horns of a chimera and 4 feet of a snork. I will need them for experiments, since I have not tried to make Svarog on my own.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svarog_1_dialog_8">
		<text>Well, I’ll get this, unless, of course, these cute little animals eat me.</text>

		<text>What’s there to tell? I’m the local bartender - but who can tell amidst this crap, yeah? We’ve been stuck here for days, barely maintaining ourselves. I took part in the defense of the president’s palace back then, migrated to Switzerland. Then I came to the Zone. I enjoyed visiting the Bar with friends, drinking and reminiscing of older days… During one of such visits I was offered a place in the the Syndicate. It was barely upholding at the time, so Dushman and I are sort of pioneers in this. So what? The roundabouts are fitting, there are people who’ve been in Afghanistan and Georgia. But people from the Baltic aren’t too eager to come, never mind the first world countries.</text>

	<string id="talk_to_aslan_about_lottery_0">
		<text>Heard that you’re interested in faction patches.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_aslan_about_lottery_1">
		<text>How can I put this? Personally, no, I’m not ‘interested’ in them - however, with morale being rather low lately, it’s an optimal method for our guys to earn some spoils of war. Plus, the high-ups want them. Here’s how it works: you bring me patches from stalkers, you get some gear or nothing at all. All of it for ten patches of any faction, apart from those of Ecologists and the Monolith, you have a chance to get a subpar artefact, or not get jack shit. With fifty patches, you’ll have a chance to get a decent artefact and some rather solid gear, but there’s also a chance that you won’t get anything. And for ten Monolith or Ecologist patches, you will get a pretty good artefact with the same chance as for fifty patches of any other faction. Fifty Monolith or Ecologist patches will guarantee you an outstanding item and good equipment dedicated only to the most experienced of stalkers, no chance of losing. You might ask, ‘why so generous?’… Because many people prefer to keep the patches for themselves as combat trophies.</text>

	<string id="talk_to_maps_3">
		<text>Well, you’re in Rostok. It’s completely safe for anyone on good terms with Duty. To the west lies the Wild Territory, the former western part of the Rostok factory. Rumours advise against going there at night. The best kill zones are held by the mercs, so you’ll likely be getting shot from two sides. There are mutants in the lower lands, and it’s better to find and stay on high ground, or stay by the warehouses… although, the mercs have those covered. That’s all about the Wild Territory. To the north lie the army warehouses, held by Duty’s ‘best friend’, Freedom. There’s nothing particularly interesting going on there, but it’s the last shelter around for sane people. To the east is the truck cemetery; stock up on anti-radiation supplies and ammo if you’re going there. There are a lot of mutants and sometimes the radiation is way past what even we consider to be normal. To the south is the Garbage… Complete anarchy going on over there. You’ve got mutants and thugs, but you’ve also got a neat marketplace, and plus, there’s some kind of hunter in the train hangar who might have some jobs to offer. That’s all for the roundabouts. Need anything else?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_4">
		<text>You mentioned something about a shelter for sane people?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_5">
		<text>Well, north of the warehouses is the Radar, an eerie place held by the Monolith. If you’re heading there, best stock up on ammunition and supplies. Let’s just say that it’s not the friendliest place you’ll come across.</text>

I’d head over there again with the guys, but there aren’t many of us left and it’d be too much to handle, since we’d rather not spend any more manpower than we need to trying to somehow get away from the centre of the fucking Zone.
